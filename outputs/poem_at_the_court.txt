Making out after the court
Before we go at it then
Until the time we dort

Two motorcycles racing into the sort
Rolling when you ride the sven
Making out after the court

Women try women port
Chinks in my pen
Until the time we dort

I just ca move they fort
I feel our smiles on henne
Making out after the court

And not mind the thwart
And we do get ta be den
Until the time we dort

Do try to hide forte
Ca holds up the hen
Making out after the court
Until the time we dort
