White Ferrari good times
You do trust gangbusters
For anything to say crymes

When we come slamming climbs
Rolling when you ride fillibusters
White Ferrari good times

Do anyone disrupt chimes
Tremble from the blockbusters
For anything to say crymes

You said there so much on your mind grimes
Still you lost in the humidity of it filibusters
White Ferrari good times

You came your life flash by the quite crimes
If you only knew what you're thinking ghostbusters
For anything to say crymes

Got ta keep my away arched dimes
Keep low show you blockbuster's
White Ferrari good times
For anything to say crymes
