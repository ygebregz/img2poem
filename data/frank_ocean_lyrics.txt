Moon river, wider than a mile
I'm crossing you in style someday
A dream maker (Maker)
My heart (You heart) breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going that way (The same)

Two drifters off to see the world
There's such a crazy world to see
We're all chasing after all the same
Chasing after our ends

Moon river, wider than a mile
Crossing in style someday
My dream maker, heart breaker
Wherever you're going, I'm going the same

Two drifters off to see the world
It's such a crazy world you'll see
What I see, who I become
What I see, who I become
We're all chasing after our ends
Chasing after our ends

Life's just around the bend, my friend
Moon river and me

When we were kids
We hand-painted strawberries on a swing
Every moment was so precious
Then

I'm still kicking
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
The entire Earth is fighting
All the world is at its end

Just in case an atom bomb
Comes falling on my lawn
I should say and you should hear
I've loved
I've loved the good times here
I've loved our good times here

Say hello, then say farewell
To the places you know
We are all mortals, aren't we?
Any moment this could go

Cry, cry, cry, oh
Even though that won't change a thing
But you should know, you should hear
That I have loved
I have loved the good times here
And I will miss our good times here

Spaceships are lifting off
Of a dying world
And millions are left behind
While the sky burns
There wasn't room for you and I
Only you, goodbye
Goodbye

Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
Could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time
The sky could be blue, could be grey
Without you, I'm just miles away
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Without you, it's a waste of time

I think I started something
I got what I wanted
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Every single record, autotuning
Zero emotion, muted emotion
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Brain like Berkeley
Met her at Coachella
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
She's in school paying
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
At least you working
But, girl, I can't feel my face
What are we smoking anyway?
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
But can you taste a little taste?

Novacane, baby, baby
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

Sink full of dishes, pacing in the kitchen
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
Little red light on shooting
I'm feeling like Stanley Kubrick
This is some visionary shit
Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
But it keeps on moving
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
I'll never forget ya
You put me on a feeling I never had
Never had, never had (Never)
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
And pick it up and put it back
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus
But there's no drug around
Quite like what I found in you, you
I still can't feel my face
What am I smoking anyway? (Ah)
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" (Ooh)
But can you taste a little taste?

Novacane, baby, baby (Shh)
Novacane, baby, I want you
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Love me none, love me none
Numb, numb, numb, numb

Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane (Oh)
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Numb the pain, numb the pain (Oh, oh)
Novacane, novacane, novacane
Novacane, novacane
For the pain, for the pain (Oh, oh, oh)
Novacane, novacane (Ooh)

Pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
All the pretty girls involved with me
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Pity, pity
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane, novacane, novacane
I can't feel, feel her
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
I can't, can't feel her
Feel her, feel her, oh
Novacane, novacane-cane

I believe Jehovah Jireh
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
I believe a woman's temple
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
I believe that marriage isn't
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
But you must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something

I still believe in man
A wise one asked me why
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try
You and I try, try
We all try

I don't believe in time travel
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
I don't believe our lives are simple
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
You must believe in something, something, something
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh

I still believe in man (Oh, oh)
A wise one asked me why (Oh, oh)
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked (Wicked)
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try (Try, try)
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
Women try, men try (Every girl tries)
You and I try (Every boy tries), try
We all try

Try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe, try to believe
Try (Just try)
Try to believe
Oh, I, I do believe, I do believe

When I was younger, I used to wonder, like

If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
Had no secret chords like Saint David
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb—
I'm riding shotgun"

We could go to my house after school
After school, after school
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late
Off 'til late, off 'til late
We could kick it in the living room
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin

And every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
And every time a brother ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me..."

Now I'm in the lab, always working late
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
She don't do that no more
No more, no more
Don't even listen to the songs I record
But she be banging that Drake in my car
I'm so far gone
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
All damn day long
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me

Now, every time somebody ask me
If I sing songs to get my women
I say, "Nah," they say, "OK, I don't believe it"
I say "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
And every time a friend ask me
If I sing songs to get at women
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"

Crazy
I plead insanity
Crazy for you, baby
Crazy, na, na

Talk to me
And I better not hear a word
Oh, do me baby
Ooh, I better not feel it, girl
Baby, I, I still got one bullet left
In my nine
Finna do a love crime, love crime
Finna do a love crime

Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes

You write me love letters
With your father's pen, oh
If he knew the freaky, freaky things
That you write with it, oh
Is it really wrong that I want
To be the baby daddy?
Is that a love crime, love crime?
Tell me it's a love crime

Eh, murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Oh, yeah, yeah

In the getaway car
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
If we ever get caught
It'd be a long vacation for two

Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
Love crimes, love crimes


That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
They never see them

And I've got this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
Five more miles 'til the road runs out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

Got some pretty good beats on this 808s CD, yeah
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated (Yeah)
I woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Ever since I lost my baby

I've had this black suit on
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
One more mile 'til the road runs out, out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

I'm going off (Oh, my pretty love)
Don't try stopping me
I'm going off (Throw me a line)
Don't try saving (You broke my heart)
No flares (You broke my heart)
No vest (You drove my love)
And no fear
Waves are washing me out

I'm about to drive in the ocean
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
Kick off my shoes
And swim good, and swim good
Take off this suit
And swim good, and swim good, good

Don't die

Who's that talking in the library?
Who's that talking in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without my muse?
Nothing special

Every book in here, I wrote
Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn
So many pages I wrote
Wish I could revise them, but there's no erasing
And the best advice I got was keep writing, yeah
And keep living, yeah
And keep loving
Oh, loving and living and loving

And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

Who's that laughing in my library?
Who's that laughing in my library? Is that you?
No, I won't put you out
'Cause what would this place be without your smile?
Nothing special

I fell in love with you, girl, oh-ooh
You let yourself inside, with no respect for privacy
You said, "There's too much on my mind,"
Then you ripped out a page
And set that shit on flame, I quit writing
Oh-ooh, I kept living, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ugh
I kept loving, ah, ah

And when the ink dries
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
Turn to dust, so will we
Dust, dust

I took a walk with the palm trees
As the daylight fell
Sangria in a canteen
Talking to myself (I can't remember)
This tattoo on my left hand
Is turning purplish blue
Daydreams of the romance
Daydreams of you (You)
My pretty woman in a ball gown
I'm "Richard Gere" in a tux
Getting married in a courthouse
Writing vows in a rush
Making out before the judge
With my teenage wife
Got a wedding band done
That I just might die with

It's an American wedding
They don't mean too much
But we were so in love
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
That's American law

M-R-S dot Kennedy
She signed her name in pen (Oh)
In the fancy, fancy cursive (Oh)
Then turned her term papers in (Oh, oh)
A thesis on Islamic (Oh)
Virgin brides and arranged marriage (Ah, ah)
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
Those poor un-American girls
After school she ran to me
Jumped in my 5.0
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
But your parents still didn't know (Oh)
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
So, baby, don't take this hard
But maybe we should get an annulment
Before this goes way too far." (Oh)

It's just an American wedding
They don't mean too much
They don't last enough
We had an American wedding
Now what's mine is yours
American divorce

Well, you can have my Mustang
That's all I've got in my name
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
But if you stay
Oh, if you stay (Stay)
You'll probably leave later, anyway
It's love made in the USA

Don't let 'em front you, they're saying you can't move
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
These friends can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
And friend, if I did it, I think you can too
These friends can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do, that we can't do
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
These friends can't do nothing that I can't do
That she can't do, that he can't do
That you can't do

A tornado flew around my room before you came
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
In Southern California, much like Arizona
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour

When I'm thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Enough to kick it
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
That's why I kissed you
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though

I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you (ooh, no, no, no)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you (you know, know, know)
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Do you think about me still?
Do you, do you?

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Yes, of course
I remember, how could I forget (how could I forget)?
How you feel (how you feel)?
You know you were my first time (time).
A new feel
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
Not in my spirit, keep it alive (spirit, keep it alive)
We'll go down this road
'Til it turns from color to black and white

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

Or do you not think so far ahead (ahead)?
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever (Oooh, oooh)

The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Living in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
The water's blue, swallow the pill
Keeping it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
Keeping it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life

The sweet life, sweet life
Sweet life, sweet life
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
Sweet life, the sweet life
Sweetie pie

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The star shine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

The best song wasn't the single
But you couldn't turn your radio down
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
Transmitting the waves
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But you're keeping it surreal, whatever you like
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Keeping it surreal, not sugar-free
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life

A sweet life
A sweet life, yeah
A sweet life, a sweet life
A sweet life
Live and die in the life

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born (Yeah)
The star shine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
The sweet life

And the water is exactly what I wanted (Ah)
It's everything I thought it would be (Thought it would be)
But this neighborhood is getting trippier every day
The neighborhood is going ape-shit crazy, ah

You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
The star shine always kept you warm
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
The sweet life

Stop thinking of this as being money
It's just money, I'ma make more
No, no no no no no
Please decondition yourself
It's not just money
It's happiness
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
That's what it is, it's not just money
It's so much more than that
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
And disappointing a girl
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
Absolutely nothing
Let's see, I have
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
It meant nothing to you
Saving my seven dollars


Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

Start my day up on the roof
There's nothing like this type of view
Point the clicker at the tube
I prefer expensive news
New car, new girl
New ice, new glass
New watch, good times babe
It's good times, yeah
She wash my back three times a day
This shower head feels so amazing
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
They just walk by, they must don't care
A million one, a million two
A hundred more will never do

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Oh, real love

Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
We are the Xanny-gnashing
Caddy-smashing, bratty ass
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
And used the shit for batting practice
Adamant and he thrashing
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
Panic and patch me up
Pappy done latch-keyed us
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts
Don't believe us
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup

Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
And all their clothes revealing their tits
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
We party in my living room
'Cause father is gone
And he left me this empire
That runs on its own
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want

We end our day up on the roof
I say I'll jump, I never do
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
She slaps my hand
It's good times, yeah
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
The market's down like 60 stories
And some don't end the way they should
My silver spoon has fed me good
A million one, a million cash
Close my eyes and feel the crash

Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
The maids come around too much
Parents ain't around enough
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
Too many white lies and white lines
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends

Real love, ain't that something rare
I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love
Real love, yeah
Real love
I'm searching for a real love
Talking 'bout a real love

We once had things in common
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
Ice-cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice-cold (Ice-cold!)
You out here flying high (High)
Go head, fly that thing!
High, high, yeah
But fly alone

You always smoking in the house
What if my mother comes over?
You can't get up and get a job
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
You're the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known

I know what I was on
I had a pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talking 'bout)
Pilot Jones, pilot Jones

Tonight she came stumbling across my lawn again
I just don't know why I keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober
See there you go reaching up your blouse
And no, I don't want a child
But I ain't been touched in a while
By the dealer and the stoner
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known

I know what I was on (Ever known)
I had a pilot Jones (What you know about it?)
She took me high (Oh, did she now?)
Then she took me home (We talking 'bout)
Pilot Jones, pilot Jones

In the sky up above, the birds
I saw the sky like I never seen before
You thought I was above you
Above this in so many ways
But if I got a condo on a cloud
Then I guess you can stay at my place
I'ma get one
I need ya
Admit it
You're my pilot Jones

You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved

Hitting stones in glass homes
You're smoking stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock
Hitting stones in glass homes
You're smoking stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and broke your home
Crack rock, crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

You're shucking and jiving, stealing and robbing
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Won't let you hold their infant
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky

Hitting stones in glass homes
You're smoking stones in abandoned homes
You hit them stones and you broke your home
Crack rock
Crack rock, crack rock

Crooked cop, dead cop
How much dope can you push to me?
Crooked cop, dead cop
No good for community
Fucking pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
Don't no one hear the rounds (Sound)
Don't no one hear the shells (Shells)

Don't no one hear a sound
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
Don't no one wanna blow the high
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
How you feeling, girl?
How's the gutter doing?
Crack rock

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra

Run run run come back for my glory
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)

Bring her back to me
(Cleopatra, hey oh Patra eh eh Cleopatra)

Run run run the crown of our pharaoh
(Cleopatra, Cleopatra)

The throne of our queen is empty
(Hey oh' Patra, Cleopatra)

And we'll run to the future
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world
A rocky, rocky world
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
As we march to the rhythm
On the palace floor
Chandeliers inside the pyramids
Tremble from the force
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids
Voices fill up the halls

Set the cheetahs on the loose
There's a thief out on the move
Underneath our legion's view
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra

The jewel of Africa
(Jewel)
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious
How could you run off on me?
How could you run off on us?
You feel like God inside that gold
I found you laying down with Samson
And his full head of hair
I found my black queen Cleopatra
Bad dreams Cleopatra

Remove her
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
No more she lives, no more serpent in her room
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra

Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
Wake up to your girl for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
I watch you fix your hair
Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
Then your six-inch heels
Catch her
She's headed to the pyramid

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

Pimping in my convos
Bubbles in my champagne
Let it be some jazz playing
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars
Floor model TV with the VCR
Got rubies in my damn chain
Whip ain't got no gas tank
But it still got woodgrain
Got your girl working for me
Hit the strip and my bills paid
That keep my bills paid
Hit the strip and my bills paid
Keep a friend bills paid

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid

You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
Touch you in places only I know
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
Can we make love before you go
The way you say my name makes me feel like
I'm that friend
But I'm still unemployed
You say it's big but you take it
Ride cowgirl
But your love ain't free no more, baby
But your love ain't free no more

She's working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
That's right
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight
Working at the pyramid
Working at the pyramid tonight

Double D
Big full breasts on my baby
(Yo we going to Florida)
Triple weight
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
And I just wanna know
Why you ain't been going to work
Boss ain't working you like this
He can't take care of you like this

Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
(There he goes, one of God's own prototypes)
Hand me my triple weight
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
(Too weird to live, too rare to die)
No I don't really wish
I don't wish the titties would show
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

She's at a stove (Who)
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope (Cooking dope)
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
No, nothing wrong (Ain't nothing wrong) with a lie (Ooh)
Nothing wrong (Nothing wrong)
With another short plane ride (Ain't nothing wrong)
Through the sky (Up in the sky)
You and I (Just you and I)

Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Girl, you know you're lost
Lost in the thrill of it all
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost

Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Love lost, love love, love lost
Faith is the substance
Manos arriba!
Then the other channel on the

Mosh pits and bare chest
Stage-diving sky diver
Spray the crowd with cold water
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
I think I need a cold shower
Cool waters
African girl speaks in English accent
Likes to fuck boys in bands
Likes to watch westerns
And ride me without the hands
Show me her passport
She's on her own tour
But you're beautiful to me
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Live in the clouds
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me
Life in the clouds
Keep em high, y'all
Beautiful stars
In the sky

Monks in the mosh pit
Stage-diving Dalai Lama
Feet covered in cut flowers
They mosh for enlightenment
Clean chakra, good karma
One with the water
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Planning a runaway, young at heart
You found a boyfriend
And now you wanna get away, get away
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Abhaya Mudra

I never ask for much
But please keep up lover
We've got no choices left
The running's fast
Run, run, run, run
You're beautiful to me
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
You mean so much to me
In my world, my world

We made it safely
Even with your father's army trailing us
We escaped him
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
What a great escape
But there's a long way still in fact
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
There's a monsoon that never ends
A coke-white tiger woke us from our slumber
To guide and protect us 'til the end

We're in the clouds
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
But you're beautiful to me, oh
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
But you're beautiful to me, oh (Right)
Beautiful

Taxi driver
Be my shrink for the hour
Leave the meter running
It's rush hour
So take the streets if you wanna
Just outrun the demons, could you?

He said, "Allahu Akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
This unrequited love
To me, it's nothing but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love me
Love me, love

Taxi driver
I swear I've got three lives
Balanced on my head like steak knives
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
I can't trust no one

And you say, "Allahu Akbar"
I told him, "Don't curse me"
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
I guess it couldn't hurt me
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
Oh, unrequited love
To me, it's nothing but a one-man cult
And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
I can never make him love me
Never make him love me
No, no, ah

It's a, it's a bad religion
To be in love with someone
Who could never love you
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Could have me feeling the way I do

And the peaches and the mangoes
That you could sell for me

What do you think my brain is made for
Is it just a container for the mind?
This great grey matter
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Is she just a container for the child?"
That soft pink matter
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
My God, she's giving me pleasure

What if the sky and the stars are for show
And the aliens are watching live
From the purple matter?
Sensei went quiet then violent
And we sparred until we both grew tired
Nothing mattered
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
My God, giving me pleasure
Pleasure, pleasure, pleasure
Pleasure over matter

Hey, hey
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
You were such a habit to call
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
She better with some fella with a regular job."
I didn't wanna get her involved
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Hopped into my car; drove far
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
If models are made for modeling
Thick girls are made for cuddling
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands

Grey matter
Blue used to be my favorite color
Now I ain't got no choice
Blue matter

You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good
For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
You're good at being bad (You're bad at being good)
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
Well, frankly, when that ocean so motherfucking good
Make her swab the motherfucking wood
Make her walk the motherfucking plank
Make her rob a motherfucking bank
With no mask on and a rusty revolver

I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
Come on, come on

My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

I know you, Forrest
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
But you're so buff and so strong
I'm nervous, Forrest
Forrest Gump

My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

I saw your game, Forrest
I was screaming, "Run forty-four!"
But you kept running past the end zone
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest?
Forrest Gump

My fingertips and my lips
They burn from the cigarettes
Forrest Gump
You run my mind, boy
Running on my mind, boy
Forrest Gump

Forrest green, Forrest blues
I'm remembering you
If this is love, I know it's true
I won't forget you
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
(You, you, oh, you, you)
It's for you, Forrest
Forrest Gump

Darker times
They're telling boulder heavy lies
Looks like all we've got is each other
The truth is obsolete
Remember when all I had was my mother
She didn't compromise
She could recognize
Voodoo
Our daughters and our sons
Are just candles in the sun
Voodoo
Don't let him see divide
Don't you let her see divide
Voodoo
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
He's got the whole wide world in his hands

There's something about you
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, telling you this right now
You're special
I wish you could see what I see

She peels an orange for us in the morning
She woke me up to give me half
I can hear the children soccer balling
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
You're a girl on this island
I'm a boy from America
My flight leaves tonight
But I don't think I'm going backwards
I won't be going backwards

You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

Silent moments, meditative poses
You break my focus, you make me laugh
Two mopeds racing through the forest
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
I'm my best on this island
I'm a mess in America
My flight left last night
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
I'm not going back home, no

You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes)
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
I'mma stay right here, with you
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes, breezes, breezes, breezes)
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
(Tropic, tropic, tropic, breezes)
I've found my gold

You're my golden girl
You're the one I've chosen, girl
You're 24K
You make it bright when it's grey
You're my golden girl
The sun has been kind to you
You're 24K (Girl)
But the sky's never grey (Never grey)

Um, you're my GOLDEN GIRL
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
Um, thanks for fucking with me
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
You see, I want you to know that
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
So that means that I don't want to go back
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Your face is the best
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
I free-fall off the hill again
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
I'm just hoping that you don't turn my neck green

These bitches want Nikes
They looking for a check
Tell 'em it ain't likely
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
You must be on that white like Othello
All you want is Nikes
But the real ones just like you, just like me
I don't play, I don't make time
But if you need dick I got you
And I yam from the line
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
R.I.P. Trayvon, that friend look just like me
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
Me and them gel, like twigs with them bangs
Now that's a real mermaid
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Punk madre, punk papá
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
And that's good enough
We don't talk much or nothin'
But when we talkin' about something
We have good discussion
I met his friends last week
Feels like they're up to somethin'
That's good for us

We'll let you guys prophesy
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
We'll let you guys prophesy
We gon' see the future first
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Devil be possessin' homies
Demons try to body-jump
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Acid on me like the rain
Weed crumbles into glitter
Rain, glitter
We laid out on this wet floor
Away turf, no Astro
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
Look at all the people feet dance
I know that your friend came with you
But he ain't with you
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
Sippin' pink-gold lemonades
Feelin'

I may be younger, but I'll look after you
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
I'll mean something to you
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
When we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
We didn't give a fuck back then
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
Everything sucked back then, we were friends

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
I couldn't see you coming
The start of nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's quite alright to hate me now
But we both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

In the halls of your hotel
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
We had time to kill back then
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?

I broke your heart last week
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Still remember, had you going crazy
Screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good

I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
The start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
Couldn't see you coming
And we started from nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
It's alright to hate me now
We both know that deep down
The feeling still deep down is good

All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
There were things you didn't need to say
Did you mean to? Mean to
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
I've been dreaming, dreaming

That's the way every day goes
Every time we've no control
If the sky is pink and white
If the ground is black and yellow
It's the same way you showed me
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
Halfway on a slow move
It's the same way you showed me
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
Up north's getting cold soon
The way it is, we're on land
Still I'm someone to hold true
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Won't let you down when it's all ruin

Just the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

In the wake of a hurricane
Dark skin of a summer shade
Nosedive into flood lines
Tall tower of milk crates
It's the same way you showed me
Cannonball off the porch side
Older kids trying off the roof
Just the same way you showed me (You showed)
If you could die and come back to life
Up for air from the swimming pool
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Gave you tools just to stay alive
And make it out when the sun is ruined

That's the same way you showed me, showed me
You showed me love
Glory from above
Regard, my dear
It's all downhill from here

Remember life, remember how it was
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Say what up to Danny
Say what up to life immortality
Bending up my Nikes
Running out the Melpomene, nicotine
Stealing granny cigs (Take it easy)
Gimme something sweet
Bitch, I might like immortality
This is life, life immortality

Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Gone off tabs of that acid
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And we don't gotta be solo
Now stay away from highways
My eyes like them red lights
Right now I prefer yellow
Redbone, so mellow
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
Think we were better off solo
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Two grams when the sun rise
Smoking good, rolling solo
Solo (solo), solo (solo)
S-solo (solo), s-solo, (solo)

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a friend would cross
And catch a solo, on time
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
All she want is her picket fence
And you protest and you picket sign
But them courts won't side with you
Won't let you fly solo
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo

It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Solo, solo, solo, solo

By myself
Solo, solo, solo, solo
(By myself, by myself)
(Solo)

This is joy, this is summer
Keep alive, stay alive
Got your metal on, we're alone
Making sweet love, taking time
'Til God strikes us
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
Gliding on the five
The deer run across, kill the headlights
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
It begins to blur, we get older (Blur!)
Summer's not as long as it used to be
Everyday counts like crazy (Smoke, haze)
Wanna get soaked?
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
We smell of Californication
Strike a pose
Everything grows in the Congo
Everything grows
Can you come when I call again?

On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim (smoke)
In comes the morning (smoke)
In comes the morning (haze)

Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
About your summer last night
Ain't give you no play, mm
Could I make you shive last night?
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Could we make it in? Do we have time?

I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
And our time was right

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
It's nothing, it's nothing
Keep a place for me, for me

Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control

Keep a place for me, for me
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
Keep a place for me
It's no thing, it's nothing
It's no thing, it's nothing

Sometimes you'll miss it
And the sound will make you cry
And some nights you're dancing
With tears in your eyes

I know you gotta leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I know you got someone coming
You're spitting game, know you got it
I know you gotta leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I know you got someone coming
You're spitting game, know you got it
(Nobody else, nobody else)
I know you gotta leave
Take down some summer time
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I know you got someone coming
You're spitting game, know you got it

Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
First time I'd ever saw you
And you text nothing like you look
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
Here's when I realized you talk too much more than I do
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
That this was much more than just some night shit
I know you don't need me right now
And to you it's just a late night out

Round your city, round the clock
Everybody needs you
No, you can't make everybody equal
Although you got beaucoup family
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Breathe 'til I evaporated
My whole body see through
Transportation, handmade (G)
And I know it better than most people
I don't trust 'em anyways
You can't break the law with them
Get some gushy, have a calm night
Shooters killing left and right
Working through your worst night
If I get my money right
You know I won't need you
And I tell you (bitch)
I hope the sack is full up
I'm fucking, no, I'm fucked up
Spend it when I get that
I ain't tryna keep you
Can't keep up a conversation
Can't nobody reach you
Why your eyes well up?
Did you call me from a séance?
You are from my past life
Hope you're doing well, bruh
I been out here head first
Always like the head first
Signal coming in and out
Hope you're doing well, bruh
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
Ooh, nani nani
This feel like a quaalude
No sleep in my body
Ain't no bitch in my body

New beginning's, ah
New beginning's, wake up akh
The sun's going down
Time to start your day, bruh
Can't keep being laid off
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
The every-night shit, every-day shit

Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
Bummed-out and shit, stressed-out and shit
That's every-day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every-day shit, every-night shit, my every-day shit
(Every-night shit, night shit, night shit, night shit)

All my night, been ready for you all my night
Been waiting on you all my night
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
All my night, you been missing all my night
Still got some good nights memorized
And the look back's getting me right

[Part II]

Every night fucks every day up
Every day patches the night up
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
1998, my family had that Acura
Oh, the Legend
Kept at least six discs in the changer
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
All the reverends
Preaching self-made millionaire status
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
Staying with you when I didn't have a address
Fucking on you when I didn't own a mattress
Working on a way to make it outta Texas, every night

Dropping baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
That kumbaya shit
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Fuck with me after my shift
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
See me bummed-out, stressed-out
That's just every-day shit
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
My every-day shit, my every-day shit
My every-night shit, my every-day shit
My every-day shit, my every-day shit
My every-day shit, my every-night shit

So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant
So low that I don't get high no more
When I "Geronimo!" I just go "Heh"
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
So low that I can admit
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
It ain't an event no more
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
When I do, I cut the pony off
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Tryna cut down on my spending
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
And bending over backwards
Over half of these hoes had work done
Saying they want something real from a man
Just saying it, we being real persons
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But darling, this only worsens
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
Don't pay no attention to it
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Looking at the other kids
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
Watching the summer come close to an end
After twenty years in, I'm so naïve I was under the impression
That everyone wrote their own verses
It's coming back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
I'm humming and whistling to those not deserving
I've stumbled and lived every word
Was I working just way too hard?

Now, to the edge I'll race
To the end I'll make it
All the risk, I'll take it
Head bang with my faux friends
We pour a taste out for the dead
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
The height right now
Might be what I need
Might be what I need
Said you wanna hurt me now
You can't hurt me now
That might be what you need

What it means to be alive on this side
(Said you wanna kill me now)
On this side
(Don't let me down)
On this side
(Down, down)
Fuck the other side
I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side
How it feels to have arrived
I'm inside, I'm inside
Those are my friends for life
Mothers of us be kind
To the fathers on whom we rely
Fathers of us be kind
To the mothers on whom we rely
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah

We know you're sugar
We know you're sweet like a sucker
Pretty sweet, pretty sweet

I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we're getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you

Just like me, they long to be close to you

Bad luck to talk on these rides
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
White Ferrari, had a good time
(Sweet 16, how was I supposed to know anything?)
I let you out at Central
I didn't care to state the plain
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
White Ferrari, good times

Stick by me, close by me
You were fine, you were fine here
That's just a slow body
You left when I forgot to speak
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes

I care for you still and I will forever
That was my part of the deal, honest
We got so familiar
Spending each day of the year
White Ferrari, good times
In this life (life), in this life (life)
One too many years
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
(Thought you might want to know now)
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
And that's life
Love

I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
You say we're small and not worth the mention
You're tired of moving, your body's aching
We could vacay, there's places to go
Clearly this isn't all that there is
Can't take what's been given (no way)
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
Primal and naked
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
And we're free to roam

The markings on your surface
Your speckled face
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
I couldn't gauge your fears
I can't relate to my peers
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Maybe I'm a fool
Maybe I should move and settle
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave (Brave)
I'm not brave

I'm living over city
And taking in the homeless sometimes
Been living in an idea
An idea from another man's mind
Maybe I'm a fool
To settle for a place with some nice views (Nice views)
Maybe I should move, settle down
Two kids and a swimming pool
I'm not brave
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather live outside
I'd rather go to jail
I've tried hell (It's a loop)
What would you recommend I do?
(And the other side of the loop is a loop)
This, this fe—this feel
This feel, this feels
This feels how molly must feel
This feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
How molly must feel

This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
This is not my life
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
It's not what I'm like
It's just a fond farewell (Brave)

Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
That could think of the dreamer that thought
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
That could dream about a thought
That could think of dreaming a dream
Where I cannot, where I cannot

Less morose and more present
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
One solar flare, we're consumed
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Eat some 'shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon

I will always love you how I do
Let go of a prayer for you
Just a sweet word
The table is prepared for you
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Ball so hard, all my boys flex
Wishing you godspeed, glory
There will be mountains you won't move
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)
Still I'll always be there for you how I do
I let go of my claim on you
It's a free world
You look down on where you came from sometimes
But you'll have this place to call home always

(Godspeed, glory)
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
Until it's time
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes (Oh)
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind (Oh)
Oh, it's 'til it's time we die
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind

Oh-oh, oh
I'll always love you
Until the time we die
Oh-oh, oh

If I was being honest
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day
And not skip a meal, I'm good
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Call my Momma like, "Momma
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma
I'm on, Momma, I'm on
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800K, Momma
To stand on my feet, Momma
Play these songs, it's therapy, Momma
They paying me, Momma
I should be paying them"
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me, Momma
Let me run this bitch
I'ma run it into the ground, Momma, the whole galaxy
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
Fuck these friends
Fuck these friends, they don't want none
Fuck these friends
Fuck you friends
Fuck me if I hated on you

I'ma stick around
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
friend, you got some just like me don't you?
Or maybe not just like me
You know I'm Africano Americano
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Family tree, throw a big shadow
(Jamming to the rhythm)
Tech company
Please gimme immortality
(It's a face to face)
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
(Keep me high, Castrati)
(Punani fade the stress)
Or pull the zip down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
(Bugatti left some stretch marks on that freeway)
Smoke some'n
(Marks on that freeway)
They tryna find 2Pac, don't let 'em find 2Pac
He evade the press, he escape the stress
La la la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la (la la la la la)

I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I know you love to talk
I ain't on your schedule
I ain't on no schedule
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I ain't on no sales floor
You say I'm changing on you
I feel like Selena, they wanna murder a friend
Murder me like Selena
You must ain't get the memo
I don't cuff bitches no more
But your bitch my exception
Come get her outta my photo
I only got one photo
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
Our friendship don't go back that far
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
friends go back that far
I ain't smoked all year
This the last song so, I'm finna wipe that off
Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
'Cause what friends say, that's what she tell her man
What a difference distance makes
friends want fight in the streets
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Dog this is chess now, not fetch
I ain't runnin' for a friend, ain't ran since track meets
That's the only time I ran from a friend
You could change this track now
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
know and know, know and know
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th though
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
Shit went 180 on me, please run that back though
(Tucks 'til 24)

You say some shit about me?
Turn a real sport, my friend
That second time Jerron was there, friend
On God he grabbed me and then that friend tried to pull me
Yeah, 'cause the friend tried to boom me in my face
I had AD in a headlock, friend, I had this friend like—

Make sure you speak up
OK
What's your name?
Ryan
Yo, ayy be quiet. What's your name? What do you do? What's your first memory?
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?
(Uh, hell no)
(You're not gonna make it, are you?)
Friendship and how it controls the world
Ha-ha-ha, alright, um, what three superpowers do you wish you had? My bad. Say it again
Flying and I want to be invincible
Alright, make sure you speak up
What's your name?
Maybe we can get a little—a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
But forever at the same time
Yo, what, what's, what's the year 3000 going to look like?
(Dog, stop, stop, stop)
(What you mean bro?)
...Or it could be great and shit can fly and buildings would be very, very tall and everybody won't know what the ground looks like
That's fucked up
Chloe, shh, okay, start over right now
Best thing about being me is I got a nice set of friends
Pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
What's the worst thing about being me? Probably, uh
Having bushy eyebrows, being Drake
I think a lot, a lot, too much. Sometimes I'm very musty
Talents, got any secret talents?
I don't think so, I'm pretty open with all – everything that I do
Talents? Um, I can play the theremin
Probably my brother just to see how much work he has in one day
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome. No, actually, no, fuck him. Um, I don't know, probably Dill 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all; just sits inside his house
What's your name?
Sage Elsesser
What do you do?
I play soccer, and I go to school
Um, I wanna be better at skating
Probably jump off something really high, super high, and try to land in like a handstand or something
Alright, that's it
I don't know, there would be a lot of things I'll do, probably spend a lot of time with my family and tell them I'm going away and probably spend a couple hours with my family and then I'll go out and just do everything that I ever thought about trying
I don't know. There's a lot of things you could do
How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
(A second, a thousand years?)

Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
Raf moving slow like a creep
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailing
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
I couldn't get from nobody out there (I can't)
When's the last time I asked for some help that
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
Nobody

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fucking with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm biking
I'm biking with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm braking... got

Biking, I'm biking, I'm biking slow-mo
Maybe the four wheel exciting us mo'
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
On my lapel, at the table, I'm giving a toast
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
Thinking maybe someone is not something to own
Maybe the government got nothing to do with it
Thinking maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
Think I want me a little one that look like my clone
Me and my baby can't do on our own
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
I'm fucking with Addy, I'm watching my dose
24 hours like they never close
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking these blocks, yeah
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
I'm biking uphill and it's burning my quads (obstacles)
I'm biking downhill and it sound like a fishing rod
Savage is biking, yeah

Transition lightning (ascending)
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Body that's gutted
A Bentley that used to be flawless
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
Scattered, the showers
Don't scaffold the towers
I'm up, mom, I promise
In class with the honors
No cheat like I'm honest
And how did I become so accomplished?
'Cause I don't see foes
I just see a code
I just see a hole
Chinks in your armor
Like Pac in the Hummer
Like Jigga in summer
Left the house like Obama
Hit the road like a runner
Hit the road like Road Runner
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking

I don't get weak in the knees
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
Open the sky, get a handful
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you not fucking with cash?
God gave you what you could handle
Gave you what you could handle
I got the grip like the handle
And I'm biking
I'm biking with me and my Daniel
Hades got the angels
TV's got the angles
I'm braking

Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got a million dollar bike
Got a million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up
Got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike
Got, got me fucked up, up
Million dollar bike


My guy pretty like a girl
And he got fight stories to tell
I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel
Swimming laps through pool water
Heated like I'm underworld
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Police think I'm of the underworld
12 treat a friend like he twelve
How you looking up to me and talking down? (Yeah)
Can't you see I am the big man? (Big man)
God level, I am the I am (Whoa)
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Rolling when you ride, popping
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
Got one that's straight acting
Turnt out like some dirty plastic (Ride)
2016: burnt some discs (Dope)
2017: ideas playing off a Walkman
This a cult, not a clique on the net
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
That's a double edge, "issa knife" (Knife)
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting (Fighting)
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick (Pow)
Clips on clips like Mikey (Hello)
It's really all

I see both sides like Chanel
See on both sides like Chanel

It's really you on my mind
It's really you on my mind
It's really you
It's really you on my mind

V both sides of the 12
Steam both sides of the L
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
Whole team diamonds is real
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves
You need a cosign for your health
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I know you need to try for my belt
I know you seen it driving itself
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
But it's stealth

I see both sides like Chanel
I see both sides like Chanel

My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they're all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
I got new money, and it's all cash
I got new bags, and they're all collabs
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
(I mean my baby bi)
Amazing, the cash online unknown
(I mean my baby bi)
Blazing the dash, counting money at home

My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
Can't be on time for the free rides
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
Can't make those calls in the low light
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waiting in line
Yeah, you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
Did I? Almost
Back home with that, almost
Back home with that, next time
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Trades with all the valley
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
Freeway

Despite our history
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (smiles on me)
I feel their smiles on me (smile on me)
I feel their smiles on me (lens on me right now)
Oh yeah, oh yeah

Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah (Know I got some sins on me)
Then get the scream mask for the vert rides (riding)
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizing (got some sins on me)
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
This thing won't last unless we're both lying (both lying)
Fake flowers, no water needed
Real life drowned by the weekend
No whens, call it timeless
No ends 'cause you're timeless

Despite our history, yeah
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Despite the life I lead
All this life in me (all this life)
Spirits watch me, pants down
Can't be 'barrassed of it
I feel their smiles on me (on me, on me, on me)
I feel their smiles on me
I feel their smiles on me

Lionel got a lens, Janet got a lens
Matthew got a lens on me right now, yeah
Cleve got a lens, Kevin got a lens
Know I got some sins on me right now

My pillows ain't giving no comfort
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
And I can't drown it out

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

I never really liked this apartment, no
There's not enough windows
That ain't the reason you left
I did that by myself
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again

Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
Every time I lay my head down
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Baby I-I'm thinking of you

Ain't slept a wink since you left me
No inspiration to dream, baby
You're my bedtime story
Bedtime but I can't sleep
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh

You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
Where's my bedtime story
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh

I love you, I love you

She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
She's thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me

Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

Said you should get a Rubi's Cube over your heart
But you say I've already figured it out
Already figured out the love
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we on each other
Loving on each other, kissing on each other

Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
Cause all of your exes are in black and white

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

Paper to pen, needle to skin
I'm in the chair
And she's over there
Taking these pictures
And blowing me kisses
When I asked her to hold my hand
She told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
Told me to take that ink like a man
She told me that, told me that

You wanna get blasted, yeah
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
And now we getting blasted
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
My feelings go deeper than the ink
It goes deeper, deep into your soul

If a tree fell in the forest
And no one was around to hear it
Baby, does it go boom?
Does it go boom?
If I have love for ya
But you were never close enough to feel it
Is my love any good?
Is my love any good?
Oh

But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulder
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

I know you're somewhere in there
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
And start chiseling away, away
Chiseling away, away
Girl my phone bill is crazy
The rate is sky high when I call ya
But you only let it ring
You only let it ring, oh

But the distance ain't even a room away
You're laying in the bed right next to me
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Some soundproof glass
And some bars in the middle
Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Shorty leftovers in garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

Stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall
He don't hear a word I say at all
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
Oh, stomp, stomp
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and
He don't hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh

Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel
And when I tap your shoulders
You're cold as bricks and steel
A pile of bricks and steel

How do I stay in love with your rubbish
All the leftovers and garbage
Was it ever real
If you were never here?
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Like a pile of bricks and steel
Bricks, bricks
Steel, steel

Reminiscing on a younger love
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Our future could've been different
But let's just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
And the broken pieces of two hearts
All the broken pieces of two hearts
It's getting heavier

Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
There's a couple things we need to talk about
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't going your way?
Can we talk about it without the shouting?

I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again

Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time

Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
For forgetting every little anniversary
Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it

I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Can't let this thing fall apart
Know it damn well that I got your heart
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again

Everybody has there arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time

Girl, I love the things you do
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Like when you walk out the door
When your clothes hit the floor
You were just about to break up
And now we 'bout to make up (yeah yeah)
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh whoa
Girl just say yeah
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh

Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time

Everybody has their arguments
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
But that don't mean we can't get over it
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time

Everybody has their arguments

'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down

It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
8 minutes ago it was all OK, yeah
I wish the year was just missing one day
I'm wishing I could forget it
'Cause it's still so hard to live with it

I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoe box under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him (thinking 'bout him)
Walking on 42nd tryna clear my brain (no, oh)
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space

I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoe box under my bed
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks (those damn clocks)
No, I don't wanna think about him
I don't wanna dream about him
I don't wanna talk about him
I don't wanna call him
This day doesn't even exist
I keep praying that it won't exist no more

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

See I don't even wanna think about him
Or dream about him
Even just one day is one too long
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
'Cause ain't no getting back the love is gone
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
The storm has passed and gone
And I wish amnesia would stay
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day

Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away

Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

On the same side of the battle, oh

Guys pull me over and then they ask me

I said yeah she got my air
And I'm running, I'm running low
Where my driver go? Man I don't care
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone

And try to be ready when I get there
In front of your door, oh baby get in

I hated every time we go out
Got everybody complementing you
You love attention from a big crowd
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend

Call me crazy
But all I want is you
To myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous
But I just call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't 'cause of me
Who else could it be?
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girls' night
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you

Call me crazy
But all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
Though it seems like I'm nagging, oh
Is wanting only me too much to ask?

When all I want is you to myself
To share with no one
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love
Greedy love
Greedy love
My, my greedy love

Maybe I should just be clear
It sucks not having you here
There ain't a better way to say
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
My ego ain't here

So many clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

I try to go some months without a call
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
Maybe I could find something in the club
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
But them girls didn't matter
And this money ain't distracting me much at all

I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you

Girl I wanted to cry
But I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To hold it in and save face
And it was harder to stay
So I made it look easy (it ain't easy)
To just get up and walk away
Now I'm alone and the tears do fall
Open my mouth and the words do fall
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart

The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And the best way to say it is to just say it
I wanna run away from the words
But I can't run away from the world
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
Girl, I love you, still

Oh, oh, oh, my
Oh, yeah yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, love, love, love
Yeah

A hundred chick contacts in my phone
About half of them I smashed

But I've been dreaming of our love
I wish my new day job was you

But they say my checks come from the bank
And not your heart (not your heart)
And not your heart
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
And not my heart

But if my job was only to love you, yeah
There wouldn't be no recession
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression

I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
I love you the rest of my life, oh
Be paid for the rest of my life

I've seen it and I liked it much
I told myself I had to have it
I looked, but I do not touch
Wondering why does she walk like that (that, that)
There was something in those jeans
Locked up
It was dying to be free
And it was bound to happen, oh

Didn't have a pick up line to use
I was way too cool, way too cool
And instead I hoped you're watching me too
Like I watched you

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

That's a good look baby, baby
That's a good look, darling
That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

My eyes must have been on drugs
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
Thin air, mid-air, no
Long brown hair swinging, no
Red bottoms in your high heels
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray

You in HD baby
I didn't know what to say
I was way too cool, I'm way too cool
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Oh yeah, you know it's true

It took one look, oh, oh, oh
Just that one look, oh, oh
What was I to do but look?
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
No, I couldn't stop
No, no, just took one look

I wanna stare at you some more
When I can feel you in my soul
I'm not looking from the outside
I could feel your hands in mine
I wanna grab on your body
Touching that booty
Feeling on your booty
Say that you love it
And you said it's all mine

That's a good look, good look
Such a good look

If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere, baby
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby
Did you know ?

News said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country's warring
The leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower babe, lower babe

I know we just met
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end, baby
Quickly

You told me I don't even know your name
I said well then we might as well make ours the same
What you think, baby?
(No time)
Vegas might as well be light-years away
So we better lie under the stars
Before they're crashing down
Cause I heard

News said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country's warring
The leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower babe, lower babe

Lou said the sky was falling, yeah

I'm afraid to say it
Don't wan't you to think I'm playing
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I'm standing naked in a crowd
And I'm sorry I know that I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
If I could I'd go back I'm exposed give me back my clothes 'cause I just can't take it
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it's cool naked with you already seen me

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

You keep on forgiving
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
When you stay it makes me forget that I'm down, now it's all so simple
'Til the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Feels so good letting go, I'm exposed, you can have my clothes 'cause I'm not afraid
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
I guess it's cool, naked with you already seen me

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
It don't matter, it don't matter, you've seen it all before
It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable

Oh you got me so comfortable
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
Still got me feeling so comfortable
Feeling so comfortable

My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
My honey, my darling, my love
I only really miss him when he's gone
Cause when we're together we argue two thirds of the time
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part

Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
Saying I'm always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You're packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I'm screaming get out

But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

Sugar bunches of oats
My buttered toast on the side
My full serving of love
And then it's like
Whenever it's just me and you
You know I don't wanna fight
But I know that you know my buttons
And when to press them, baby, dammit

Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
Saying I'm always complaining
I tell you, just leave me alone
Here you go
You're packing your things and
You're lacing your sneakers
I'm screaming get out

But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
You gotta leave

Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
Before we go at it again
It's just gon' happen
I don't understand it
My heart's sane
But my mind's going crazy

But don't go, don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
I say that you should leave but don't go
Don't go, don't go, don't go
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go

I told you to go
So why did you leave
I beg you to stay
I want you to go
So why did you leave
I told you to go
So why don't you stay
I begged you to stay
So why are you here
I want you to leave

Oh, just go
No stay, go
Stay, go, stay, go, stay

Get on my bike and I'mma fly through time
Until I'm with you
I promise

I'm scared
I guess I shouldn't be
But I'm a boy
In this adult body
I know I said
That we would grow old together
But I haven't
And that's cost you years

This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go

I tried
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
Until the years just started to flicker past
Our life, oh all of it
I saw memories on both sides of the road
I pointed them out as I went along
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it

This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself

I'm on my way there
To that time in space
I wish you could see, all that I see now
I'm headed towards you, yeah
I wish that time could wait
I'm on my way home

This is has been the one of my fears
That's has only ever caused you tears

So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Can't let her live by herself
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
She ain't living by herself
Lift off and go

Do you remember, that October night
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I thought that we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
I guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

All I ever did was just try to play my part
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
I wanna crack his dome, (t-tell me that I'm wrong)
But I thought we were

On the same side of the battle
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
Guess what we have doesn't matter

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

You have me dying
Fighting, every night
Dying
Fighting, every night

You have me dying every night, just because
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
We never giving up from fighting in the club
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
You got me fighting every night to prove my love

On the same side of the battle, oh

Look up, look up, look up
You'll see the lies flying in the air
Reach out, reach out
Try to catch one if you can

Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
Causing kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Feels like I'm on the 30th floor
Staring out my window
See them, they about to crash
Right into you
You're marching on the sidewalk
Umbrella up, oblivious
No clouds, shades on, no sun

Oh, right now they're flying
Circling and coasting the sky
When they come crashing down
It'll be the worst surprise

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
'Til you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Look up, look up
You better look all around, all around
Baby you better
Look up, look up, I know
They're coming down, coming down
They're coming down
Look up, you better look up
Look up, look up, look up, look up

But you just right stand there
You ain't looking 'round
And baby, you won't never see it coming
A thousand kamikaze
On they're way down to you
But you won't never see 'em
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Till you look up
And I bet you'd catch it
If you took a sec to look up
I know the truth is blinding
But you gotta look up
Or you'll never see it coming
You'll never see it coming

Look up, look up
And baby you'll see the light
You'll see him flying
Look up, look up
You'll see the lies
No, look up, look up
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
Flight 143 was just on the ground

Hey let me tell you something
Don't be fronting like he ever did it like I does it
Every time you wanna argue and stress
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
Well I guess you coulda
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda
'Cause when you was with him
You was always checking for the kid
Late night coming to my crib

I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
With a swag like me
He ain't quite me, like me
I, I, I, I, I know you better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I know better
I, I, I, I, I know you better

So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
('Cause it's just for you)
I'm trying to settle down
(Tell me who)
You know could make you smile
(Like I can do)
Tell me who, tell me who

Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in
(No I don't wanna) but I gotta answer this call
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
(And then the kid came) told me he was my biggest fan
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone

How'd I get distracted, I
Don't know what happened, I
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
Oh

I lost my angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
Has anybody seen her?
I'm out here checking for my, angel in L.A., L.A
(And where she at?)
I'm posting pictures of her
(And where she go?)
She got me driving around the backstreets
I thought I saw walking right past me
I called you didn't answer to your name
Where's my angel?
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?

(No I don't wanna)

I just wanna make love

I just wanna make love

Play a couple chords, jump on board
If you wanna ride out (if you wanna ride out)
I'mma hit a few keys, bring you down to your knees
So you don't wanna leave now (don't wanna leave)
I got you up in my house now, ow
Fix you up another Mai Thai, Thai
No sun on the horizon, on
Let's make a song for the night time, time

I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano

Stroke of harmony, kiss you on your neck

I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
And make you climax now (ah ah)
Now we switching up the melody, ay
We take it down to a minor C, C
We making noise like we can't believe, ay
Let's put this moment on replay

Love, love on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano
I just wanna make love, on my piano

Love, love on my piano

Oh
Girl, what you wanna do?
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
I think I got a clue
Girl, what you wanna do?
You wanna make love, love on my piano
Love, love on my piano

Love, love on my piano

I'll stack these magazines in the corner
After I'm done with them
And I still got the same hope that I started with
That you'll be in one of them
My camera shed some tears since you left him
With nothing, with nothing

How am I supposed to remember?
I got the memories
But memories fade, baby
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

We didn't make love
We celebrated its invention
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye

How the hell am I supposed to remember?
Tell me now, I got the memories
But memories don't last
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
What's gonna make me remember?

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you

No videos, no Polaroids
No record of the love we had
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
To catch my heart break in half
No smiles on my picture frame, no
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
Models, wedding pictures, you know

That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
They were part of our history, this story
I was always taking pictures
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
Miss you so bad, miss you so

I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
I made love to my lady before I packed
I left her while she slept
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
But I won't risk her life for mine
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

I'm running water through my hands
And flipping pictures in my head of her
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
So I wouldn't worry as much
Oh, last night
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
I left the keys to the car by the bed
'Cause I got her
(I got you, oh)

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I wish you could be my Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't risk your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(I know you love me)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(You wanna be where I am, but no, girl)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie

The money should last awhile
But I know without a dime she got me
When the feds come around she got me
No snitching allowed from my baby

Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(My Bonnie)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(My Bonnie)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie
(No Bonnie)
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
(Oh girl, I wish you could be mine)
But I won't risk her life for mine
(Won't you risk your life, no Bonnie, your life)
No oh, not for mine
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry

So sorry
So sorry
No Bonnie

No love still
No love still
No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love
I been writing all day, filling my page
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain
No love still
No love still
No love still
No
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself
It's no love, none
No love still
No love

I'm knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it's a chore
But I won't stop loving you that's for sure, that's for sure

You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
It's non-stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
It won't stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
It's non stop, oh no, oh no, oh no

I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I'm still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
I wish you'd just peak out the blinds to my heart
But you turned your bedroom light on
Well at least that's a start

You could open your window baby
And ask me to go away
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
It's non-stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
It won't stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
It's non stop, oh no, oh no, oh no

Said I'm sorry, oh baby
But the love won't stop, no no, nah uh
Take me back, oh love, take me back
Cause the love will keep flowing on
The love will keep flowing on

Fairy-tales come and take my hand
Turn the page and help me understand
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
If I know how the story ends
Her song has me
Looking for traces of my melody
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
And not another she can deny
Caught in the sound waves
She can feel my every line
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

So ohh in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

Found a way to whisper in her ear
Everything I wanted her to hear
Said I would catch her every tear
Hold her through the many years
So long I've been looking
For chances of this heart in me
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
That explains the meaning of life
There is no music
Without her to give it to me
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
For her, yeah

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the song she loves
And I never thought I'd say this baby

So in love, ohh in love
Ohh in love, ohh in love
I want to be, the one she loves
And I'm hoping that she plays me


I had my feet in the water
And right when I was about to get up
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
With a hook line and a sinker
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon' live down there
Well baby you can love up here, on land
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

You said you're feeling ways
That you never could've felt under all that pressure
Used to it being dark at night, and you're kinda afraid of the lights
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
What a difference it makes to breathe in
What a difference, it makes it easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

Baby I could show you the world
And the seed that's inside of my heart, baby
Don't know how you got on land in the first place
Just promise you won't go back again
It's better up here you know
Just trying my best to show you
But you started feeling like you're floating higher and higher
Don't ever go under no more

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

The open air makes it easy
So easy to love
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
The open air makes it easy
Easy to love

Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
On the track to stars and back
Only after we get to the end

Passing planets feeling small
On the mattress floating off
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl

But you look good in your spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"

The candle's burning in the sun
We don't need them but you like them
They glow they glow, oh yeah
We were at the bar for quite a while
Took some time but we collided
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful

But you look good in that spacesuit
I can't keep my hands off you
Plus it's easy to love you
Oh, up here, up here

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

We can make believe that we're up there
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse ooh
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
But they won't bother us, no no no no

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
I'mma take it slow, slow
While the rockets burn, they're burning
We'll be making love, baby
Rocket love, rocket love ooh

Turn a lamp on
Let me talk to you
See that light bulb, does something to you
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
Come close to me if that's you
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
The lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Just turn the lamp down
Don't talk to me
That light bulb, took something from me
Or gave something to me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Took freedom, gave purpose
Can't blend in, too perfect
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies

Myself ain't never talked to me like that before (No)
I wonder what on earth he's searching for

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

Mirror, mirror on the wall
Who is the fairest of them all
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones

No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Scared of the good more than the evil
Scared of the light more than the dark
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
I'm scared for you
I'm scared of you
Scared of beautiful

I know I'm not weak, these heavy thoughts
They been on my mind, oh, I
I got cargo with me
All these memories feel
Like a thousand pounds, oh my
In my bed trying to sleep
The ceiling lowers down
I feel it on me now

I been moving buses, further and further
I just can't do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload

Drag my life along by the end of a rope
Trying to make by, I'm trying
On the other side, someone's tugging hard
They only getting stronger, oh, I
Balance bricks on shoulders
With the grit in my shoes
I'm not strong enough
Help me out, help me out

I been moving buses, further and further
I just can do this alone
I just can't do it alone
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
I just can't move them alone
And I just can't move them alone

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me

I been trying to hold up the world with both my hands
Been holding the world in both my hands
Can't hold up the world
It's coming down, it's coming

It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
It's too heavy for me
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me

I built us a little gingerbread house
You said you loved it, I baked you a little
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
You ate through 'em, you ate through 'em
You ate through 'em, yeah, yeah

Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby

We took chartered flights
All around to taste those malls that
You like most, said the jefe food taste like pink raspberry
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce
Said you liked Ruth's Chris way better
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down

Tell me how does that taste
Tell me how does that taste, oh
When I re-up, got you coming back
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing

I know that you're going to
Love me as long as you're fed, you said
But I like you around
Just want to keep you here
I got to know girl, I ain't running out
I ain't running out

Baby, I can't blame you
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing

Hey baby, I've noticed you eat your jewelry for break
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for break
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for breakfast
I swear, it's crazy
I didn't notice the signs
You covered both of my eyes
(Mix-match text messages, voicemail evidence)
The audience yelling, "Damn, she's blind."
Now it's all so clear
And I was also not scared
(Now I know she missed stunt double skipped on it)
Audience kept yelling, "Not the space

(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lying
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recording each take of crying
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping
(But the end's here) And I can't change it

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
(Guess you kept missing it Homeboys visiting)
The audience yelling, "Yeah, that's right."
And now it's not so clear
You don't know how you missed me (Gone)
Gone while you were gone
Stopped going through your phone
The audience yelling, "'Bout damn time."

(I could say that I knew the whole time) But I would be lying
(You'd have to be a hidden camera) Recording each take of crying
(I would say that I would just go to your part) To stop the taping
(But the end is here) And you can't change it

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

Everything was okay when I was the victim
Had me made out to be so naive
Never knew I was working on a masterpiece
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
So now as the credits roll
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds

The suspense is building
Sitting on edge of my seat now
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
While the plot was thickening
I was hanging off the cliff love
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?

(Ending... Ending... No...)
You didn't notice the signs
You thought I'd just let it slide
Yeah

So fresh (so fresh) oh yes
And I, know I was in love with you
First moment I met you, butterflies
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
First word that I spoke it made you smile
'Cause I got a little style going
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
'Cause it started the conversation
That led to our first date, now
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
I know it's true if they're just like you

So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
Each time when I closed my eyes
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
You're like my favorite
I swear you could play forever

You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues

She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothing for me
You can't do nothing for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fucking night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down

You see if I was another type I'da run away from you
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
So tell me your name or something, she said "Is it game or something?"
"You pulling the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"

She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothing for me
You can't do nothing for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
"It's nothing personal"
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
And all fucking night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
I see the end of the night

And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh

I'm standing by your locker
In the hallway after class
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
The drawing in my binder
Every picture I put a halo on your head

I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
I wish you could taste it
'Cause it's surely melting

I'm on waiting on my angel
My first love
My first kiss
My second, my third
The one my momma like so much

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
However long

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still

I'm standing, still fucking waiting
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
As the time flies faster baby
You could fly, fly faster baby
I'm standing, standing still
I'm standing still, standing still
Oh, standing still

Tryna help her, help her

Her body said get over here
If I knew she had a man

But I don't really understand
How you blind and you can't see it

When you sleeping at night she's creeping out
It's not you it's us that she's worried about

Tryna help her, help her

She don't love ya, love ya
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love

And I'm sorry for ya


Oh, we're in this together
Have a little faith
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Oh, we're all children
We're all human, we're all breathing
We're all needing, more than what they're giving
Can't you feel it?
The space of what's missing

You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
So you look down
'Cause you've convinced yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together, we're together

I love you
And I don't know you
But I know the light in you
Is the same as in me
I trust you, like a brother
'Cause who could understand the pain
Better than someone who's going through it

You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
But don't you look down
Don't you convince yourself
That this is all you've got, all you've got

Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

I've searched the souls of my people
For something to believe in
Oh, not words that I could say
But I heard them, I heard them

Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
Picture four billion faces held high for love
If there's one thing about this world I know
It's that we're in it together
You're not alone, I'm not alone
If there's one thing about this world I know
We're together

Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a, just a dream
Just a, just a dream

From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
I'm falling, down a well
Wish you were the water there
Just like a sun without a flame
Fell asleep without a dream
I saw the light fade
I let it drift away
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Gravity won't hold my feet
(How'd I let my love breathe?)

I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)
Wake up
Wake up
Wake up

I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
Maybe he could tell me the way
To your heart again
I click my Js three times wishing she would've stayed
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Found a diamond for your ring
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
I woke up, she ain't there
Levitating off the mattress
Baby where you at?
I said, oh, baby where you at?

I saw my life flash by the very minute
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
In a little glass bottle

Got to save, save me
I know you see me fall
I know you've come to die
Save, save me
My love is in the glass
My life is in that bottle
Wake up (just tell me that's it's all in my head)
Wake up (remind me that you're still in my bed)
Wake up (the thought of sleeping in my arms again)

I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
Please give me my trees, give 'em back
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Give me noise, just give it back
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone

I made you the mayor of my town honey
And I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city
Gave you, power over, power over me
Give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

Tell the government, please give me funding
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Too much water can you push it back
How you just gon' leave me out of order
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost

I made you the mayor of my town honey
I'm why you are the senate representative
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

We used to be sky high
We used to be major
We used to be sky high
We used to be major, baby, major

Give it to me, give it back to me
The city mine, baby
This whole city is mine
The city is mine, honey
Give it to me, give it back to me
The city is mine, oh baby
The city is mine
The city is mine
Now give it to me
Give it back to me
The city belongs to me
The city is ours no more

Sitting next to your coffee table
I'm trying to fix your cable box, again
Said you couldn't get channel four
And that's the only one you wanted to watch

Scrubbing your dishes

No baby don't do that, don't touch that
Could you please be still? (Baby, stop)
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl

You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

Now you know you should be sleeping, but OK
I'll give you ten more minutes
We've been sleeping in the same bed
'Cause you've been having nightmares
And you need me here
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl

You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I said ain't no sugar for you
Well, just a little bit, but

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

You're old enough to drink
But when it comes to love you think
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
Temper tantrums out in public
'Cause you want it when you want it
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror

My best friend
What was cooler than us?
Whole school already knew what it was
Kiddy-crushing, puppy-loving, no
Ah, you are my high school wifey
College made it different
I stayed at home and you didn't
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
Drove my heart two thousand miles away

And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

My best friend, wish I could have went with her
Can't afford to visit her
Let alone stay
But I wanna, I really wanna
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
I'm praying, oh, you come back again

And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her

My baby (baby), what am I to do without her?
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her

And now I sit at home, next to the phone
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
I'm in the zone
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And I'm alone, I'm alone

Can't play the same songs in my car
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
And I can't even play Madden any more
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
She won't say hello, hello, hello
She won't say hello, hello, hello
Nah, nah, she won't

Taking turns with pressing ignore
Only to come to the conclusion
That there's no one we both love more
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
Girl I love you
But I just can't do this revolving door any longer

I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more

Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

Maybe it's the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Ironically, in the beginning that's what made us close
And now that's the very reason
That we're slamming doors
But we're both adults, it's time we get over it

I'm motion sick
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
What happened, we were close
Where did we go wrong
Better yet, how do we make it right
This ain't making sense no more

So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

If we stop this fighting
We can dance all night in this bitch
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Won't be no fighting, I'ma throw the towel in
'Cause I decided, I like us way better like this

So I put my left hand on your waist
Right hand throwing the peace sign
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
I put my lips up on your face
White rag up in the sky
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I'm calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, truce
Calling a truce, calling a truce
Oh, yeah

Yeah, bring an amp up here
Let me plug my guitar in
I wanna play for you baby
Can you hear me?
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
I'm kind of nervous
And they yelling my name out
Can you hear 'em?

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

I really love my fans
So we gotta move quickly
And once I finish here
Don't shout out encore
You can sing along to my songs, and then
Then I'll applaud you, and then

Oh, oh, oh
Oh, I would cancel if I could (whoa, oh, oh)
Oh, oh, oh
You said if I loved you then I would

Make it a private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better than the radio
Bet-bet-better than the radio
Live so much better, live so much better

Private show, intimate affair
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
If you want a private show
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Private show, intimate affair
Dancing in the front row, only one here
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And you want a
VIP, backstage pass and all that
VIP, backstage pass and all that

These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
They also took off the dress of that woman
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
A simple, simple mistake
Simply made it so hard for you to love me

It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

My mother said, "Son, don't break her heart
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple."

These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
Simple man, couple simple problems
One simple, simple mistake
Simply made it hard for you to love me

It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooh
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
Then maybe we could move one ('cause I really can't)
Move on (I gotta)
Get on (I gotta)
Get on with our hearts
With ours lives, 'cause they're simply too short
Without love

It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
It's simply hard, so hard
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love

I heard my teacher say that I'd be better off
If I just took what I've been given
They said I never know what to do
Unless I'm told
I feel underestimated, so unaccounted for
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
And tell me your version of my future

But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, don't talk me out of my life
It's my life

I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob's desk
But she never liked me
She said I'm gon' fail, no matter what I give
She said 'cause my skin wasn't light enough
Tuition wasn't high enough
I couldn't understand just what I did
So underestimated, you left me unaccounted for
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future

But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, don't talk me out of my life
It's my life

Just tell me how
You're much better than me now
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
I'm still standing
Look at me
Look at me now, look me in my eyes

But let's take all the frames off your walls
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
Don't talk me out of it
Don't talk me out of it
It's my life, don't talk me out of my life
It's my life
