It's 6:47 still thinking 'bout him 
And I'ma give you chills, harmonizing to Otis, Isley, Marvin
I don't mind, cause
You break my focus, you make me laugh
You'll see the lies
A million one, a million cash
You in HD baby
Treat us like we can't erupt, yup
But you're my only, baby you're my only
To be in love with someone
The white dress and all, yup the rice and all
Man, I had a dream and then this shit came true
Demons try to body-jump
Last week I was walking your dog, baby
Heard you like to take the love
I saw your game, Forrest
Torso marked up like a vandal
How you looking up to me and talking down? 
Still got me feeling so comfortable
No, no no no no no
You say it's big but you take it
Gravity won't hold my feet
Polo sweats and Hermes blankets
Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
I need you around me
I've loved the good times here
Why you think I'm in this bitch wearing a fucking Yarmulke?
Our skin like bronze and our hair like cashmere
It's the difference between happy, being happy and sad
And I better not hear a word
That you getting freaky with
We're all human, we're all breathing
Ain't slept a wink since you left me
Say what up to Matthew, to Shoob
Won't let you fly solo
You told me you were single, and
Be my shrink for the hour
'Til God strikes us
And that's good enough
See them, they about to crash
You just gotta follow, follow, follow
Let me plug my guitar in
Is it really wrong that I want
Hand me my triple weight
You can't hurt me now
Fast forward now we're grown-ups
Little red light on shooting
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for breakfast
A wise one asked me why 
By the dealer and the stoner
Rocket love flew past me yesterday
I'm headed towards you, yeah
Stick by me, close by me
So many pages I wrote
And never mind the sun

My every-day shit, every-night shit, my every-day shit
Better yet, how do we make it right
And I'm why you are the senate representative
It's only awkward if you're fucking him too
Oh but there might as well be a brick wall in between us
Make her walk the motherfucking plank
No more, he has killed Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Rolling when you ride, popping
You didn't come out tonight so a man could talk to you
It's that we're in it together
If you want a private show
You're shocked to find out how it all unfolds
You'll probably feel better by the weekend
Form me a circle, watch my Jagger
Click-clicking my heels wishing away the day
You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born 
It's not the same, ivory's illegal, don't you remember?
You can call it jealous
And how do I stay in love with your rubbish
Summer's not as long as it used to be
I did that by myself
You're my homie, baby you're my only
Fade in and your lips touch mine, oh
Myself ain't never talked to me like that before 
'Cause she was and you are madly involved, madly involved
These hands that I pray with for just one more chance
Your father really likes me
Keep 'em high, y'all, show you right
The table is prepared for you
I can't lie I still would hit it
My baby , what am I to do without her?
You thought I was above you
I say, "Yeah," they say, "No fair, no fair, it's cheating"
Every moment was so precious
After school, after school
Private show, intimate affair
And the aliens are watching live
He calls me son
A thesis on Islamic 
He packed his luggage and he left, but some of it still remains
Ménage on my birthday, tap out on the first stroke
That there's no one we both love more
Got a million dollar bike
Feet covered in cut flowers
Then turned her term papers in 
To settle for a place with some nice views 
Spray the crowd with cold water
Maybe I should move, settle down
My every-day shit, my every-night shit
Can you hear me?
I wish you'd say you simply can't fall out of love with me
There ain't no sense in bringing it up or bringing memory round
The suspense is building
Nod my head, don't close my eyes
But it ain't easy, no it ain't easy
V both sides of the 12
Mirror, mirror oh you're so unfair to all of the beautiful ones
It's no love, none
But it keeps on moving
Writing vows in a rush
I'm just hoping that you don't turn my neck green
friends want fight in the streets
And the pages turn to dust, so will we
It's my life, don't talk me out of my life
How you feeling, girl?
I should say and you should hear
I'm on waiting on my angel
You told me I don't even know your name
Where's my bedtime story
Lionel got a lens, Janet got a lens
But I like you around
The way it is, we're on land
You have me dying
I know we just met
And it was bound to happen, oh
And when the ink dries
From the purple matter?
Feeling on your booty
 And you can't change it
With another short plane ride 
It's for you, Forrest
Ayo, we got one
No baby, you can't have that, until you eat your dinner
Told me on the phone
This day doesn't even exist
Sensei replied, "What is your woman?
Saving my seven dollars
So time machine, take me ahead 'til I'm with her
I'm dropping the top, I'm letting it in
And millions are left behind
He's got the whole wide world in his pants
I ain't on no schedule
'Cause I got a little style going
I'm biking with me and my Daniel
I'll keep quiet and let you run your phone bill up
I don't wanna call him
I went to see Jigga, she went to see Z Trip, perfect
Cause the hardest thing to say is usually worth saying
I don't believe in time travel
Don't scaffold the towers
Put a zoom on that stick, Noé, up so close I'm on that kill
My eyes don't shed tears, but, boy, they pour
What do you think my brain is made for
Trades with all the valley
You'd kneel down to the dry land
Love, love on my piano
Wherever you're going, I'm going that way 
Right hand throwing the peace sign
She don't do that no more
Running out on us
But the sky's never grey 
Be back by the next sunrise
Walked off the stage
And instead I hoped you're watching me too
All they seem to care about is me Kim or Lindsey
Before this goes way too far." 
I need that bitch to grind on my belt
I told you to go
What good is a jewel that ain't still precious
Quite like what I found in you, you
I worked on my grand finale, yeah
The markings on your surface
No, I don't wanna think about him
You could change this track now
I wish you could see, all that I see now
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down
Rolling marijuana, that's a cheap vacation
Novacane, baby, baby 
And tell me your version of my future
I know what I was on
That's the moment that I see her as she leaving
Their home, their home, yeah, yeah
You dream of walls that hold us in prison
Like I'm watching a Blu-Ray
What am I smoking anyway? 
With a hook line and a sinker
'Cause I got her
Just three words to my bedtime story, bedtime story oh
If you could die and come back to life
But they won't bother us, no no no no
We've been sleeping in the same bed
You must be on that white like Othello
Give me floodgates, give me levees
Weed smoke in the sky, picture what I'm realizing 
Revenge in the air makes my lungs sick
That's why I came to town
High flights, inhale the vapor, exhale once and think twice
Trying to guess your favorite flavor
In class with the honors
Oh, couldn't run away from you
Does it go boom?
You only let it ring, oh
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste"
It's non-stop, oh no, oh no, oh no

If there's one thing about this world I know
'Cause ain't no getting back the love is gone
Oh, we gotta pick it up now, slow it down
I woke up, she ain't there
Give it to me, give it back to me
What a great escape
They tryna find 2Pac, don't let 'em find 2Pac
Reach out, reach out
I'm up, mom, I promise
Then your lipstick, Cleopatra
I told him, "Don't curse me"
But you still crack a smile, because it makes you feel alive
I wanna wake up from this dream
Voices fill up the halls
No inspiration to dream, baby
If the lights go by, that means the cops flew by
This is life, life immortality
Take me back, oh love, take me back
When we were kids
Don't no one hear the shells 
In the fancy, fancy cursive 
My baby, my sweet pumpkin pie
To that time in space
Yeah yeah I know they wanna see me
Girl just say yeah
When you sleeping at night she's creeping out
I know you go up, go up
I'm simply wrong, but I still wanna hold ya
Just a, just a dream
You know I love it when the ride is smooth
Wake up to your girl for now let's call her Cleopatra, Cleopatra
Your color and your shape looked so crazy
And to you it's just a late night out
A pile of bricks and steel
And all fucking night-night, it's gon' be tonight-night, yeah
All this life in me
You keep on forgiving
And cyanide in my Styrofoam cup
I feel like Selena, they wanna murder a friend
If you took a sec to look up
No flares 
Got rubies in my damn chain
Rolling when you ride, ride the Rodman
The way she bit her bottom lip after we kissed
Robertson, Melrose and Hollywood
All my night, been ready for you all my night
What was I to do but look?
Dim the lights and fall into you, you, you
It's nothing, it's nothing
I play soccer, and I go to school
It'll be the worst surprise
Underneath our legion's view
Daydreams of you 
But you say that's how you know it's right

I let go of my claim on you
I'm wishing these 4 walls could talk, talk
And I'm sorry I know that I'm wrong, yeah, I'm wrong
Good jeans, with good care
You gotta find the answers to the problem
She got me driving around the backstreets
I'm searching for a real love
Look at me now, look me in my eyes
The start of nothing, I had no chance to prepare
Come close to me if that's you
Who going solo baby?
Back and forth, emotional tug of war
First time I'd ever saw you
And now we getting blasted
And with the streets all dark, the buildings look lost
I'll always love you
The audience yelling, "Yeah, that's right."
Oh, oh you're calling me crazy
But please keep up lover
I couldn't get from nobody else, yeah?
How molly must feel, this feels how molly must feel
I had a pilot Jones 
Whenever it's just me and you
I know you need to try for my belt
But we were so in love
Is she just a container for the child?"
On the mattress floating off
How you just gon' leave me out of order
You're spitting game, know you got it
Until the time we die
Don't mind the lights
Live in the clouds
And we started from nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
Lower and lower babe, lower babe
I wish I taught the girl how to shoot a gun
To guide and protect us 'til the end
You know I won't need you
I know it's been so long
You'll see him flying
I could have a place in your world
Did you mean to? Mean to
Showed 'em how to shine by theirselves

Look up, look up, look up
Purchasing crappy grams with half the hand of cash you handed
But I don't think I'm going backwards
It's non stop, oh no, oh no, oh no
Missing, wishing she would call
And say hello, say hello
This is joy, this is summer
Angel, I can't find another you
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, I can't feel a thing
Could have me feeling the way I do
Too many bottles of this wine we can't pronounce
Your brother, I think he hates me
I wanna see your pom poms from the stands
And that's for the females that can't spell, but
That everyone wrote their own verses
Noses on a rail, little virgin wears the white
It ain't a secret
It's like she never heard of me, heard of me
You're much better than me now
Don't ever go under no more
We pour a taste out for the dead
Looking for traces of my melody
Bad luck to talk on these rides
Ain't give you no play, mm
Can't believe that you would let me touch your heart
But we're both adults, it's time we get over it
Drove my heart two thousand miles away
Jumped in my 5.0
So fresh, so fresh, so fresh, so fresh
We still got moonlight
When the feds come around she got me
I know I try to play it cool when we fuss
To share with no one
They looking for a check
Come get her outta my photo
And no one was around to hear it
Now I ain't got no choice
I guess it's cool naked with you already seen me
Remember life, remember how it was
Now I got a backpack full of this hurt
So I wouldn't worry as much
To hold it in and save face
But the truth then and the truth now have been the same
Now I'm standing here after all, with this broken heart
Ohh in love, ohh in love
And we're free to roam
And make you climax now 
Shooters killing left and right
Hijabs and polygamist husbands
I got the keys, so I'm driving alone
Baby, yeah, baby, yeah
Finna do a love crime, love crime
I'll sleep between y'all, it's nothing
If you knew him you'd wanna quit too
Kept at least six discs in the changer
We once had things in common
Staring out my window
We didn't make love
Couldn't see you coming
Cause whenever you kiss me, girl
But that don't mean we can't get over it
I'm standing still, standing still
You got what I what I, I, needed
You can't tell me why you're so terrified of beautiful
Yeah I know I'm probably wasting my time
You said it's a surprise! What's the surprise... ending?
Lean back my seat, watch your head go down
After school she ran to me
'Cause I didn't wanna miss a thing, miss a thing
And you told me on the phone
I love you, I love you
And make it out when the sun is ruined
And you don't know how to act, so no more sugar for you
On the same side of the battle
Cause he's lonely and I've got you
And the water is exactly what I wanted 
I just can do this alone
Hide my tattoos in Shibuya
Every book in here, I wrote
I ain't making minimum wage, Momma
Gotta keep your back arched up
TV's got the angles
If I could I'd go back I'm exposed give me back my clothes 'cause I just can't take it
Turn a lamp on
But I don't really understand
Whatever feels good, whatever takes you mountain high
Take off this suit
So I can weigh the work I got on your girl
And I'm hoping that she plays me
Well baby tell me how it feels
Cause I know that loving me is a chore, it's a chore
Shout out to Hollygrove, I'm from that 7th though
Just in case an atom bomb
Then you want to call me to your office right after school
Breathe 'til I evaporated
This love is gonna keep going, it ain't gonna slow
Now I know that she's the lyric and the tune
Love me none, love me none
Run, run, run, run
What's gonna make me remember?
We're together, we're together
Can't be the last time, that you get mad at me
I'll be honest, I wasn't devastated
But you're keeping it surreal, whatever you like
Paper to pen, needle to skin
Best friend said I ought to wife you today
We're in the clouds
Simply made it so hard for you to love me
But there's no way, no how I'll stop loving you
I only got one photo

No more she lives, no more serpent in her room
She's just taking all your money
Keep a place for me
I'm on, Momma, I'm on
I think I hear 'em coming down the hall and
Something like no other, your lover, your best friend, oh
I watch you fix your hair
Start my day up on the roof
Virgin brides and arranged marriage 
Didn't have a pick up line to use
No, you can't make everybody equal
And the look back's getting me right
Screaming my name, the feeling deep down is good
But listen here, I got some shit on my mind
And then it's like
All the world is at its end
The love is gonna keep us cool
I know it's obvious that I'm the talk of the town
You better look all around, all around
I make stacks and stacks of cake in the bank, bank
If I sing songs to get my women
But you gotta love me quickly, quickly, oh
But I would say, "Girl, don't be dumb—
You make it bright when it's grey
Taking turns with pressing ignore
I just don't know why I keep on trying to keep a grown woman sober
Turquoise, ocean green, hurricane silver, yeah
It's love made in the USA
So take the streets if you wanna
Ah, you are my high school wifey
I'll mean something to you
Overload, overload, but no Superman will save me
Fuck these friends, they don't want none
She said ooh-woo-woo you can't do nothing for me
That's kinda rude, but I like your attitude
1998, my family had that Acura
Can't be 'barrassed of it
It's not just money
A sweet life, a sweet life
You are from my past life
Exactly what it cost us to get here to get this pair 
But them girls didn't matter
I'm on my way there
Bed full of women, flip on a tripod
After 'trina hit I had to transfer campus
Can't play the same songs in my car
Heated like I'm underworld
The start of nothing, ooh, I could hate you now
Even when I'm fucking, Viagra popping
Then you break their hearts in pieces
I got plenty concrete, plenty steel
You wanna make love, love on my piano
But they're to cool to be honest
Our life, oh all of it
Don't try to hide it
We can go to paradise
That's like never, 'cause I made you use your self-control
Is the same as in me
Come on, come on
Up north's getting cold soon
I'm about to drive in the ocean
We don't talk much or nothin'
I need love all night, all night
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion
There were things you didn't need to say
I don't understand it
Let 'em know them lights will never turn off
Our friendship don't go back that far
Living so the last night feels like a past life
Safe in my rental like an armored truck back then
I'm my best on this island
I got new money, and it's all cash
That keep my bills paid
I built us a little gingerbread house
Talents? Um, I can play the theremin
If I know I'm breaking the law
I know, you told 'em baby
Oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh
And all their clothes revealing their tits
And I know it better than most people
Oh, I would cancel if I could 
I wanna keep that smile on your face, all for it
We hand-painted strawberries on a swing
Basic takes its toll on me, 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
No sleep full of dreams, I'll stay
We made it safely
I've had this black suit on
Can't nobody reach you
All the pretty girls involved with me
And the broken pieces of two hearts
Pretty girls involved with me
Memory seats I'm sitting on stay heated 
I ain't tryna keep you
I know you go up, you go up
Cannonball off the porch side
You don't know how you missed me 
Why your eyes well up?
I let it drift away
But it still got woodgrain
A hundred chick contacts in my phone
But I know the light in you
On the same side of the battle, oh
Lou said the sky was falling, yeah
But you must believe in something, something, something
Never knew you, so never knew how this felt
'Cause you've been having nightmares
But she's been gone for some years now
Remember when I had that Lexus, no
When I'm older, and my mind's telling me to forget you
Family tree, throw a big shadow
My brother get popped and don't no one hear the sound
You cut your hair but you used to live a blonded life
Somewhere in your nights you're stuck when you think of me
Can't you feel it?
There's no where I'd rather be
I sing along to every single word though
You don't know how little you matter until you're all alone
We know you're sugar
The suns gone be setting in a while
A lifetime of good fade and good wear
Oh you got, away, away, you flew away, away
That you can't do, that we can't do
But don't go, don't go
It'd be a long vacation for two
The every-night shit, every-day shit
If we build a house in paradise, will we get to heaven still?
But if you need dick I got you
An idea from another man's mind
You're tired of moving, your body's aching

Oh baby, when I wanna talk to you
I ain't runnin' for a friend, ain't ran since track meets

They flashing, it's like dynamite
You can't break the law with them
I called you didn't answer to your name
And you protest and you picket sign
And I will miss our good times here
I took a walk with the palm trees
Of a dying world
No, look up, look up
Sweet love, we'll be making, oh
Above this in so many ways
The start of nothing, had no chance to prepare
Here's to the good guy, he hooked it up
And how did I become so accomplished?
They said I never know what to do
'Cause I decided, I like us way better like this
Cause this love will keep us cool

You were such a habit to call
The diamonds is plural, the Tiffany brooch
Don't have much longer, baby

But sweetie, you tell me now that you're craving
But you were never close enough to feel it
Probably jump off something really high, super high, and try to land in like a handstand or something
Or do you not think so far ahead ?
We gon' see the future first
To get here, to get there to get this pair of ours
But you won't never see 'em
No Bonnie, no Bonnie, I'm sorry, so sorry
Regardless of winning, instead of pretending
Um, I trust you, Golden, for wed ring
Tryna fix this, wrecking my brain
All this beauty ever gave me was a reason for some beautiful lies
'Cause what friends say, that's what she tell her man
Ooh, I better not feel it, girl
With all my might, I peddled as fast as I could
And catch a solo, on time
My negatives at home aren't working for my Kodak
Who goin' solo baby?
To catch my heart break in half
You're my homie, baby you're my homie
I'ma do what I said and take you to the bridge
How's the gutter doing?
There ain't a better way to say
Chasing after our ends
You thought I'd just let it slide
We are all mortals, aren't we?
You were fine, you were fine here
This tattoo on my left hand
You must ain't get the memo
'Til you look up
I just wanna make love, on my piano
Ironically, in the beginning that's what made us close
And not your heart 
Without you, I'm just miles away
But you look good in that spacesuit
And he left me this empire
I want you to leave
I put my lips up on your face
I don't believe my hands are cleanly
We could vacay, there's places to go
Shit went 180 on me, please run that back though
Always like the head first
Just a, just a, just a dream
And every time a friend ask me
VIP, backstage pass and all that
Watch you, you tell em baby
Zero emotion, muted emotion
After I'm done with them
I swear you could play forever
Now and then you miss it, sounds make you cry
Say what up to life immortality
But you'll have this place to call home always
She want me to get a spaceship tatted inside of my lip
 told me he was my biggest fan
No whens, call it timeless
Cause the lights are gonna be on us
Ain't no answers here without you, no
Let's see where I land, I'm like Gilligan
Like jumping over the broom
I won't forget you
How you not fucking with cash?
I broke your heart last week
Or something in the mall, mall, mall
Cause you know I've been missing ya baby, missing my baby
I'm posting pictures of her
"You pulling the famous card, it's cute and all but not enough"
But this neighborhood is getting trippier every day
If I get my money right
Mosh pits and bare chest
Even with his archers' bows at our backs
No good for community
Might lose my jacket and hit a solo, one time
Back when Boswell and Percy had it active
But she be banging that Drake in my car
Oh, oh, oh baby
Is wanting only me too much to ask?
I know you see me fall
Blue used to be my favorite color
Oh you got me so comfortable
Left the house like Obama
I know I said
Your apartment out in Houston's where I waited
The globe is warming
All the leftovers and garbage
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by?
Don't know what happened, I
Used to date a blonde, you used to hit it raw
Rocket love, rocket love ooh
Just trying my best to show you
No sun on the horizon, on
Pitch corrected, computed emotion, uh-huh
They mosh for enlightenment
Just like me, they long to be close to you
So you don't wanna leave now 
There's something about you
Sitting next to your coffee table
Murder me like Selena
I'm in Emerald City, looking for Wizard Oz
I'm humming and whistling to those not deserving
Since you think I don't love you, I just thought you were cute
Remote controller on your lower back, yes, the good
When I was younger, I used to wonder, like
Flawed crystals hang from your ears
Just picture four billion hearts beating with you, with ours
I know you've come to die
So low that when they throw pussy or pesos
So by the time you thought you had me, yeah
We've got no choices left
And every time somebody ask me
Sometimes I wanna pick up a hammer
In comes the morning 
Play these songs, it's therapy, Momma
Gone while you were gone
Just promise you won't go back again
But you're beautiful to me
Can't take what's been given 
The height right now
It don't matter, it don't matter no, you've seen it all before
Couple bishops in the city building mansions
Back home with that, almost
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift, yeah
Found a diamond for your ring
Oh, I wish she could be the Bonnie to my Clyde
Can't believe I got her out here cooking dope 
I'm fucking with Addy, I'm watching my dose
On the track to stars and back
And I've got this black suit on
Maybe I should move and settle
I'm fucking, no, I'm fucked up
I'd be paid for the rest of my life, rest of my life
We didn't give a fuck back then
We could kick it in the living room
Pretty fucking, sunrise in sight
Chinks in your armor
Me and my baby can't do on our own
Pour up for A$AP, R.I.P. Pimp C
Stopped going through your phone
Tell me where you want to go
I can't feel a thing, I can't feel, feel, feel, feel her
S-solo , s-solo, 
Raf moving slow like a creep
What a difference distance makes
I just see a code
When I re-up, got you coming back
Everybody has there arguments
Run, run, run, run, you'd better run
Big sun coming strong through the motel blinds
What a difference, it makes it easy to love
And am I standing in it?
Simply made it hard for you to love me
The audience yelling, "'Bout damn time."
No vest 
They don't mean too much
We all try, the girls try, the boys try
When I asked her to hold my hand
You let yourself inside, with no respect for privacy
I'm coming to get you, coming
So we better lie under the stars
Touch you in places only I know
'Til the end, even when, I look dumb like I do when I lie
Keep em high, y'all
So why see the world, when you got the beach?
Flight 143 took off a minute ago
To just get up and walk away
You laugh in my face but I didn't care
I believe a woman's temple
So many clever words and nice things that I could say
My flight leaves tonight
Bring her back to me
We'd drive to Syd's, had the X6 back then, back then
Could you wait, it really won't be long?
Cause my eyelids ain't heavy enough
Two drifters off to see the world
Ain't no service way up here girl
Oh, we did everything together, now I'm missing all the silly shit
No bedtime story, bedtime story, oh
There was something in those jeans
But if you stay
Just the same way you showed me 
You need something, tell me something, gather something to hold
Ain't no bitch in my body
Dropping baby off at home before my night shift
Might be what I need

And just ahead I can see your heart falling but I can't save it
If it brings me to my knees, it's a bad religion, ooh
You say we're small and not worth the mention
Just outrun the demons, could you?
Every time we've no control
Don't try saving 
You see, I want you to know that
I saw my life flash by the very minute
How'd I get distracted, I
Can't be on time for the free rides
Who else could it be?
Drag my life along by the end of a rope
I say, "Shit, oh well, oh well," ha
Tell me who, tell me who
You can't do nothing for me
Shorty leftovers in garbage
I'd rather go to jail
I got what I wanted
If you could see my thoughts, you would see our faces
Said she need a ring like Carmelo
Whip ain't got no gas tank
I won't be going backwards
What I see, who I become
The neighborhood is going ape-shit crazy, ah
You must believe in something, something, something
This, this fe—this feel
We'll go down this road
I couldn't see you coming
Lost in the thrill of it all
Never make him love me
I feel their smiles on me 
He mad, he snatched his daddy's Jag
But can somebody lend a hand it's too heavy for me
I ain't running out
I need love in the morning
The sun has been kind to you
That she can't do, that he can't do
Cause deep down inside those brown eyes, I'll see you
You need a cosign for your health
And I'm alone, I'm alone
Spaceships are lifting off
That's why I kissed you
You always say you could've stayed with your ex
You're marching on the sidewalk
And I was also not scared
Real love, I'm searching for a real love
Dwell on my gifts for a second, a moment
Calling a truce, truce
Right now it's the difference between you being able to go to a prom
I'll give you ten more minutes
So low that I can see under the skirt of an ant

Know it damn well that I got your heart
My pillows ain't giving no comfort
Yeah, so I put my left hand on your waist
The drawing in my binder
God level, I am the I am 
Try to be the man who would not let you get taken advantage of
You got enough cash to buy your favorite drink too
Oh-oh-oh, only bad, only bad religion
Well at least that's a start
No baby don't do that, don't touch that
I know you, you stole my girlfriend"
But you gotta look up
 But I would be lying
One simple, simple mistake
The rate is sky high when I call ya
When you say I don't do that, but you know I ain't perfect
Girl I love you
Couldn't weigh the love I've got for the girl
Never knew I was working on a masterpiece
Could you bring back all my police, give me order
That's a good look, darling
I'm a simple man, got some simple problems
Maybe I'm a fool
If we ever get caught
I'm a boy from America
I just can't do this alone
The ceiling lowers down
You turn my dark into light, you're like a bucket of bleach
Kiss the Earth that birthed you
Bones feeling dense as fuck, wish a friend would cross
I'm on this side, I'm on this side, I'm on this side

Flying and I want to be invincible
Say hello, then say farewell
I got cargo with me
Ashes and remnants of ballers
Best thing about being me is I got a nice set of friends
But you're beautiful to me, oh
I never really liked this apartment, no
Tyler slept on my sofa, yeah
We too loud in public, them police turned down the function
Took your clothes to the cleaners
The city is mine, oh baby
We can drive for miles 'til no one can see but just you and me, oh
So low that I can admit
Know you need the money if you gon' survive
I could feel your hands in mine
That's has only ever caused you tears
Time to start your day, bruh
A wise one asked me why
But I can't run away from the world
You like most, said the jefe food taste like pink raspberry
And you want a
And not skip a meal, I'm good
Butter knife, what a life, anyway
I let you out at Central
And why when your with your friends it's always movie night or girls' night
Oh, I couldn't run away from you
My full serving of love
I beg you to stay
Be paid for the rest of my life
So why don't you stay

We been some hustlers since it began, dude
Let's toast and listen to Michael Bolton
Donald Trump said buy an apartment with her 
Think we were better off solo
Blazing the dash, counting money at home
Well baby you can love up here, on land
Every night fucks every day up
Maybe the four wheel exciting us mo'
Feels like I've gotta Lambo' with no gas to go
I been out here head first
But you started feeling like you're floating higher and higher
We can make believe that we're up there
Mirror, mirror on the wall
Live and die in the life
Now, every time somebody ask me
I say, "Nah," they say, "Who do you think you kidding?
Kinda like your army, your air force, your peace corps
Stripper booty and a rack like wow
Ever since I lost my baby
Love me, love me
In the wake of a hurricane
White Ferrari, good times
"Two minutes ten seconds and counting"
When your clothes hit the floor
They only getting stronger, oh, I
I didn't notice the signs
I feel underestimated, so unaccounted for
I'm down for whatever right now
No cheat like I'm honest
We'll both be high, the help don't stare
Or is it just one of them days, when things ain't going your way?
friends go back that far
Love lost, love love, love lost
All I ever did was just try to play my part
Though it seems like I'm nagging, oh
But I ain't been touched in a while
It's simply hard, so hard
Tryna cut down on my spending
Like Pac in the Hummer
Better yet grab a hammer and start breaking the clocks 
Like a pile of bricks and steel

And I bet you'd catch it
Then your six-inch heels
It's a free world
And you made me lose my self-control, my self-control
Right here, right now
Solstice ain't as far as it used to be
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile
All the broken pieces of two hearts
Whatever feels good, whatever takes your mountain high
I can never quite get enough
My guy pretty like a girl
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked
New ice, new glass
One too many years
Don't go, don't go, don't go
But we're getting older, baby
Every time you wanna argue and stress
I'm on that ledge, she grabs my arm
The sky could be blue, I don't mind
Now it's mosh pits and wet tits
You out here flying high 
There's a bull and a matador dueling in the sky
I'm sure we're taller in another dimension
With tears in your eyes
Now I'm alone and the tears do fall
But baby could you love me quickly, quickly
Ooh yeah, I'ma make myself a hot link when I get home
Turnt out like some dirty plastic 
Girl I wanted to cry
We both know that deep down
She wash my back three times a day
Even love ain't, 'cause this nut cost, that clinic killed my soul
Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me
You're wet and you're warm just like our bathwater
I don't play, I don't make time
Panic and patch me up
But picture four billion hearts beating with yours, with ours
Just know that I would like to stay here and hold that
It's alright to hate me now
Pills, high enough to touch the rim in that bitch
I ain't had me a job since 2009
I just wanna make love, love on my piano
Dog this is chess now, not fetch
Um, I wanna be better at skating
See some colors, light hang glide off the moon
Here's when I realized you talk too much more than I do
And now you wanna tell me, your version of my future
He's got the whole wide world in his hands
This feel, this feels
Good credit, A1, just like that sauce
Maybe the government got nothing to do with it
The city is mine
All we ever do is whatever the fuck we want
I can't lose focus, focus, focus
Oh, I know you been patient
But you say I've already figured it out
But when I'm drunk I act a fool
They never see them
And I feel like I need them
Ah, now the sky could be blue, I don't mind
I saw memories on both sides of the road
Got on my buttercream silk shirt and it's Versace
And even if you're half Japanese, roots run deep
Chopper in the sky like a gun trick 
Talking to myself 
Silent moments, meditative poses
...Or it could be great and shit can fly and buildings would be very, very tall and everybody won't know what the ground looks like
No, no, just took one look
Still I'm someone to hold true
Stripper booty with a rack like wow
Shirt in the breeze like I'm sailing
I'm falling, down a well
Fuck me if I hated on you
Bitch, I might like immortality
I looked, but I do not touch
Tonight she came stumbling across my lawn again
But maybe we should get an annulment
I feel their smiles on me
Girl you got me thrown off
OK, I'm gonna tell you everything
I'm not strong enough
I don't trust 'em anyways
It's just a fond farewell to a friend
But we can't let it go, 'cause they wanna see us apart
Said you wanna love me
But you couldn't turn your radio down
I don't believe our lives are simple
Oh I really ought to ask
My honey, my darling, my love
And no, I don't want a child
Took freedom, gave purpose
If I know how the story ends
'Cause it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
Some I'm not too proud of, some I wish I could burn
Cleve got a lens, Kevin got a lens
It's an American wedding

And baby, you won't never see it coming
Tall tower of milk crates
In a little glass bottle
You feel like God inside that gold
You know I'm Africano Americano
Even with your father's army trailing us
And it was harder to stay
Making out before the judge
If I left this place today with the love that we made
I just can't move them alone
And disappointing a girl
Been holding the world in both my hands
Super rich kids with nothing but loose ends
Fix you up another Mai Thai, Thai
Gravity's blowing up my phone, don't wanna answer
My life is in that bottle
She didn't believe me when I said that I lost my faith
Our war is over, our queen has met her doom
When you stay it makes me forget that I'm down, now it's all so simple
But now I can't go a day without ya'
Pappy done latch-keyed us
I'm skipping showers and switching socks, sleeping good and long
Been writing all day, tryna work it out
I'm going off 
Turn the page and help me understand

Tolerance is so low, still smoke a whole 'gar
A good pair of dark blues
Can't you see I am the big man? 
Found a way to whisper in her ear
I care for you still and I will forever
Sink full of dishes, pacing in the kitchen
You ate through 'em, yeah, yeah

About half of them I smashed
I'll never forget ya
You gotta help me sleep this ain't healthy, no way
I couldn't play guitar like Van Halen
We care enough to never let them drag, never let them tear
Crack rock, crack rock
A coke-white tiger woke us from our slumber
So low that I can give a fuck about what is trending
Crazy for you, baby
Vert feel like some Gucci sandals
I lost my angel in L.A., L.A
It's never enough baby
But you knew me well, you knew I had a love on a different scale
Don't no one disrupt nirvana
All the newest shit, and the Benz I baked you
We out by the pool, some little mermaids
I wish that time could wait
The maids come around too much
Gives her the right to choose, but baby, don't abort
And you could teach me how to slow dance or something
Try to believe, try to believe
Can't make those calls in the low light
Oh-ooh, I kept living, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, ugh
I landed a trick, got my impossibles
That ain't the reason you left
Let's make a song for the night time, time
I want you to love me like ya know the worlds about to end, baby
Want to see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
Feels so good letting go, I'm exposed, you can have my clothes 'cause I'm not afraid
Oh baby, I'mma take it slow
Cause that's what she feel like she on when we on each other
But all I want is you to myself
La la la la la, la la la la la
I see the end of the night
When you're not here, I'll save some for you
You look down on where you came from sometimes
So I made it look easy 
We making noise like we can't believe, ay
I blame it on the model broad with the Hollywood smile, ow
If you think about it, it'll be over in no time
I wake up eating breakfast thinking 'bout ya'
It's just a fond farewell 
So you look down
Wet your lips first, lick the tip now
Girl, what you wanna do?
I can't keep my hands off you
And right when I was about to get up
Right there, we're making out listening to Purple Rain in the basement
Fuck the other side
Tonight-night, at the end of the night-night
With a cup in a cup, Actavis
With astonishment while I'm on punishment
She stay blasting Trey and his songs
Along with my hard drive, no notes, no goodbye
Swimming laps through pool water
It's coming back different and, yeah, that shit hurts me
Look up, you better look up
It's just an American wedding
Real life drowned by the weekend
I couldn't get from nobody out there 
I need her yeah, she got my air
Maybe I should just be clear
Baby, I can't blame you
And at sunset they're gonna try and get away, get away
Had no secret chords like Saint David
Take down some summer time
After twenty years in, I'm so naïve I was under the impression
I was way too cool, way too cool
Yes I'm falling, but can't seem to find the words
I been thinkin' 'bout you
I've seen it and I liked it much
I'll be the boyfriend in your wet dreams tonight
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind
We only human and it's humid in these Balmains
This is the home of the brave, land of the free
I just see a hole
I woulda put tints on my windows, but what's the difference?
In Southern California, much like Arizona
Woo, fuckin' buzzin', woo!
I'm back at it, automatic
Everything I wanted her to hear
I'm calling a truce, truce
Working on a way to make it outta Texas, every night
But your love ain't free no more
To this choir, to this atheist?
Yeah we talk on the phone everyday
Despite our history, yeah
Or if I was singing 'cause that's what the bitches wanted
He said, "Allahu Akbar"
They glow they glow, oh yeah
A dream maker 
Monks in the mosh pit
Bags with all that Rally's in 'em
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach
Enough to kick it
And I'm sorry, girl you gotta know it
Fucking pig get shot, three hundred men will search for me
Wanna film a tape on the speed boat?
Thinking maybe the feeling just comes and it goes
I've stumbled and lived every word
2017: ideas playing off a Walkman
Could you take me to the hills
Then my phone goes to ringing in, ringing in

And flipping pictures in my head of her
Confetti on the mattress – I used to have those images
Wake up 
Look up, look up, look up, look up
I can never make him love me
Don't shout out encore
That I just might die with
It took one look, oh, oh, oh
It wouldn't matter anyway, yeah
Shorty my plane leaves at nine AM tomorrow
Picture four billion faces held high for love
Is turning purplish blue
Now stay away from highways
All these memories feel
Oh, if you stay 
Now the only thing we share is the refrigerator
I'mma stay right here, with you
And I don't know you
Who could never love you
With no mask on and a rusty revolver
I wouldn't do it, nah, no
You said you loved it, I baked you a little
Hey baby, noticed you eat your jewelry for break
Tremble from the force
I'm needing mine, I'm needing mine
But guess who had to clean it up, yeah
You could get sensitive, but this shit ain't true
Cause the love will keep flowing on
My love is in the glass
My every-day shit, my every-day shit
It's just gon' happen
Phone dead, can't talk to you right now
Said I won't let go until you feel you're ready
Parents ain't around enough
Baby I'll do it
Don't be fronting like he ever did it like I does it
Waving truce, waving truce, waving truce
Now I'm something like the chemist on campus

Probably my brother just to see how much work he has in one day
What would you recommend I do?
You didn't notice the signs
Looking through my whole vinyl collection
Can't let her live by herself
She's in school paying
But your parents still didn't know 
The whole truth, not fractions of a bad lie
Can't let love go spinning down the drain now
With my teenage wife
Passing planets feeling small
Then get the scream mask for the vert rides 
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures

And that's the only one you wanted to watch
Let's see, I have
Put her purse down, and try to battle-rap me
Then the other channel on the
I'm in the zone
There is no music
Tonight I came home they were just embers in the fire
I should be paying them"
The first wedding that I've been in my twenties
If the ground is black and yellow
I swear I've got three lives
Could we make it in? Do we have time?
Off 'til late, off 'til late
But forever at the same time
Murder, murder, murder she wrote
No, I couldn't stop
I'm trying to settle down
Then you ripped out a page
She used to stop by, come and holler at me
Don't let 'em front you, they're saying you can't move
And the peaches and the mangoes
Can't you see that I'm doing bad?
New car, new girl
Oh when the sky starts, sky starts changing
But you look good in your spacesuit
I gave you the key to my city, all power over, power over me
I can't relate to my peers
I have loved the good times here
We are the Xanny-gnashing
And our time was right
You showed up after work I'm bathing your body
I rubber band a bunch of thousand-dollar Delta gift cards
You have me dying every night, just because
You covered both of my eyes
Feel me like our time is sprinting faster
So I put my left hand on your waist
You was always checking for the kid
Got to save, save me
Plus it's easy to love you
Other than how I just said it, clear, clear, clear, clear
Whether you like it or not
You're a girl on this island
Living in Ladera Heights, the black Beverly Hills
I wish I could've simply say I'm sorry, baby ooh
Big full breasts on my baby
You said if I loved you then I would
Keep a friend bills paid
I don't wish the titties would show
Know I got some sins on me right now
The city is ours no more
Play a couple chords, jump on board
I believe Jehovah Jireh
Out with the girls for the night and us guys, you give 'em the blues
The open air makes it easy
But Jesus Christ, don't break my heart
You said, "There's too much on my mind,"
Swear I'm amazed, yeah
Between a man and woman, but between love and love
I can't ask my girl
Hey let me tell you something
If he knew the freaky, freaky things
When you knew they were all that I had left – nothing left
Cause I couldn't let you do it by yourself
Won't be no fighting, I'ma throw the towel in
My mistakes take the pretentiousness down like I'm standing naked in a crowd
Talents, got any secret talents?
Looking at the other kids
I can't use an elevator, to get back up to you
And not another she can deny
I'm a mess in America
Get on my bike and I'mma fly through time
Make it difficult to run and hide don't it?
'Cause it's still so hard to live with it
And set that shit on flame, I quit writing
Bricks and steel, walk around my kitchen
Won't let you hold their infant
Devil be possessin' homies
I only really miss him when he's gone
But, baby, I could see you pacing on
It goes deeper, deep into your soul
Just a sweet word
Barely know me baby
We know you're sweet like a sucker
I'mma hit a few keys, bring you down to your knees
Over half of these hoes had work done
That's a good look baby 
Less morose and more present
You ain't looking 'round
They paying me, Momma
And this money ain't distracting me much at all
That's right baby kiss me like the earth is quaking
Won't let you down when it's all ruin
Keeping it surreal, not sugar-free
Now it's all so clear
I wish you'd just peak out the blinds to my heart
Oh no because I can't pass to her, pass to her
Lift off and go
My mother said, "Son, don't break her heart
Gave you what you could handle
But you only let it ring
Too many bowls of that green, no Lucky Charms
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you so bad, miss you this bad
I met you on the TV screen
Without you, it's a waste of time
And ride me without the hands
Making sweet love, taking time
But you still came around, ate your lunch with me
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try
Pretty fucking, underneath moonlight now
And I miss him more than a fraction when we part
And some bars in the middle
And now I sit at home, next to the phone
And we sparred until we both grew tired
I catch Zs at work now
Walking on 42nd tryna clear my brain 
Got a love like denim 
I hope the sack is full up
That girl just let me know
But don't worry baby, just stay close to me
Wish I could revise them, but there's no erasing
Ice-cold, baby, I told you, I'm ice-cold 
Well, you can have my Mustang
Grab a seat, just try to hear me out girl
Having bushy eyebrows, being Drake
I wanted that act right in Colorado that night
This thing won't last unless we're both lying 
But I know without a dime she got me
New watch, good times babe
I'm high up, the raindrops keep falling
That's good for us
Satellite need a receiver, can't seem to turn the signal fully off
What you think, baby?
I, I, I, I, I know you better
Make her swab the motherfucking wood
Because I'm stronger and the Congo is dim 
Everywhere I go it's a media frenzy
Yeah, bring an amp up here
Gravity's calling my phone, I can't answer
Can you hear 'em?


You've had a landscaper and a house keeper since you were born
'Cause for all I know
Reminiscing on a younger love
I tell you, just leave me alone
You've see my blown fuse, 'cause everybody's on you
Just like a sun without a flame
Running out the Melpomene, nicotine
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I'm x-ing off the calendar days
My silver spoon has fed me good
We're all chasing after all the same
Miss you so bad, miss you so
Oh, not words that I could say
Oh, where'd you go, Forrest?
Now move it right, left, switch it up
I got the grip like the handle
Saw my lighting, click, click, click
Don't no one hear a sound
Long as I'm with her, with her, with her
And I'm just a guy with a couple of open ears for her
What am I gonna show to my kids, baby?
I wish the year was just missing one day
Moon river, wider than a mile
I just can't do it alone
All you want is Nikes
Left, right, switch it up
Reminds me of the reasons why I'm with you
Sweet life, sweet life
Amazing, the cash online unknown
Everything sucked back then, we were friends
I put eighty-seven grand cash in the glovebox
But I just can't do this revolving door any longer
These bitches want Nikes
So that means that I don't want to go back
It's going down, down, down
No Bonnie, no Bonnie
Her body's fierce she's like scorpion
I been trying to hold up the world with both my hands
Fuck 'round, be cutting you
She handed me a ice blue bong, whatever
Sleeve rips off, I slip, I fall
Sensei went quiet then violent
I know you, Forrest
You're smoking stones in abandoned homes
Oh baby stop there, right there
We used to be major, baby, major
I'd say long as I could fuck three times a day
They banned my Visa, my Amex and Mastercards
And let the weather, weather ours
Oh, baby if you like
But there's a long way still in fact
That this is all you've got, all you've got
Been waiting on you all my night
Close your eyes to what you can't imagine
And swim good, and swim good
And we don't gotta be solo
How could you run off on me?
With the grit in my shoes
And when I tap your shoulders
You're my bedtime story
But memories fade, baby
Got no way to explain it, but I know we can make it
Said you couldn't get channel four
See that light bulb, does something to you
I'm so far gone
My fingertips and my lips
And the best way to say it is to just say it
Clips on clips like Mikey 
Could I make you shive last night?
Your face is the best
Everybody knows you fly, fly, fly
Only to come to the conclusion
Wake up 
They call you home
I say excuse me, how could I convince you to stay?
I'ma try to swim from something bigger than me
I'm waving truce, waving truce, waving truce, truce
I gotta get back to the money
It won't ever get old, not in my soul,
There's nothing like this type of view
Saturdays I'm at the snow cone spot
Sweet life, the sweet life
I'm thinking cotton candy, maybe
Kept my mouth closed, we're both so familiar
The candle's burning in the sun
Domesticated paradise, palm trees and pools
Turn to dust, so will we
Maybe he could tell me the way
Just keep your body close and don't let go
Could you please be still? 
That could think of dreaming and getting a glimmer of God
The sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet life
I ain't got no lights and no fuel to start up
Simply hard but I gotta get back to your love, your love
I had AD in a headlock, friend, I had this friend like—
I been thinkin' 'bout you 
They been on my mind, oh, I
Every picture I put a halo on your head
Biking, I'm biking, I'm biking slow-mo
Baby where you at?
And baby you'll see the light
Point the clicker at the tube
You said you're feeling ways
I'm wishing I could forget it
That's a good look, good look
Now that's a real mermaid
One day you gonna stop and you gonna get caught
Life in the clouds
Feels like they're up to somethin'
All the risk, I'll take it
Moon river and me
But it won't be the last time, it can't be the last time
Caught in the sound waves
Knock all the magazines off, yeah
The money should last awhile
I'm changing up your voice sound 
I ain't smoked all year
My pockets snug, they can't hold my 7
I'm in that air and it's hard to breathe
Be no recession, ain't no depression, depression
I'm biking uphill and it's burning my quads 
Yeah yeah yeah yeah
There's a couple things we need to talk about
The twenty ninth, I almost lost my life
Yo, ayy be quiet. What's your name? What do you do? What's your first memory?
So fresh  oh yes
But can somebody lend a hand, it's too heavy for me
I can't decide, I can't decide
Doors are closing, doors are closing, doors are closing
Crammed in some time, now I'm your whole life
The only thing I wish is all that's in your heart
I'm 'a take it slow, I'm 'a take it slow, oh
I hate that it's like this, I feel for you, ant
Those poor un-American girls
Flight 143 was just on the ground
Get on with our hearts
That runs on its own
Now you know you should be sleeping, but OK
On the palace floor
Two kids and a swimming pool
I took a seat on the ice cold lawn
It's simply hard but I gotta get back to your love
When's the last time I asked for some help that
Oh, it's a sold out crowd
And when I tell you right, left, switch it up
I'm running water through my hands
Like a thousand pounds, oh my
Your family stopped inviting you to things
Switch worlds and we can huddle then
But I've been dreaming of our love
You got me fighting every night, to prove my love
Fuck these lames, they don't want none
And someone's gonna break your heart
And that mean cheap, 'cause ain't shit free and I know it
Oh oh oh oh, let's make up, oh
'Til it turns from color to black and white
Likes to watch westerns
Punk madre, punk papá
Doing 90 tryna' get to you
Been living in an idea
With two hearts, one future girl I know it's hard
She's headed to the pyramid
That my little cousin, he got a little trade
Whoa I've been losing patience calling her
Well, frankly, when that ocean so motherfucking good
And swim good, and swim good, good
Um, thanks for fucking with me
Who's that talking in the library?
But you let it go on, and every time I see you with him
So low that I don't get high no more
There wouldn't be no recession
They said you love that girl
Whole school already knew what it was
She said, "I've had a hell of a summer
I say I'll jump, I never do
I wanna see the one diploma that says "you can read the stars"
On the other side, someone's tugging hard
Where my driver go? Man I don't care

I wonder what on earth he's searching for
So pardon me if I am being insensitive
But there might as well be a brick wall in between us
No videos, no Polaroids
Miami, Amsterdam, Tokyo, Spain, lost
How the hell am I supposed to remember?
We party in my living room
Before they're crashing down
Nothing wrong 
Girl, I don't take it personal, no no
Know them boys wanna see me broke down
But don't you let her go
You'll see the lies flying in the air
Just listen for the signs
And his full head of hair
Why do you drive the talent crazy, crazy
That second time Jerron was there, friend
I ain't myself at all, had to tell myself, "Naw
Our future could've been different
My best friend, wish I could have went with her
And I'm 'a ask Prince
The truth is obsolete
Or maybe not just like me
He don't hear a word I said, oh, oh, oh
Like when you walk out the door
Tell me how could you take the pictures, pictures?
And she's gone take it the wrong way if I question her
I left the keys to the car by the bed
I swear the air's so much better up here than down there
And you say, "Allahu Akbar"
Never had, never had 
Grapevine, mango, peaches, and limes, the sweet life
I know some clever words and nice things that I could say
But I won't risk her life for mine
In my bed trying to sleep
I know what I was on 
What a difference it makes to breathe in
These friends can't do nothing that I can't do
See on both sides like Chanel
When I hear that another kid is shot by the popo
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes
Why do you drive the talent crazy
You could fly, fly faster baby
Faith is the substance
The space of what's missing
Make her rob a motherfucking bank
Forgot to tell you, gotta tell you how much I vibe with you
And pick it up and put it back
Los Angeles, India, lost on a train, lost
Or gave something to me
I was hanging off the cliff love
He evade the press, he escape the stress
My heartbeat loud as my sixers, sixers
Kept me floating in the air, that's how it felt
You see if I was another type I'da run away from you
Freeze smoke rings and they hail
My girl made him wait 'til the hours of the night
Too many joy rides in daddy's Jaguar
But I heard them, I heard them
Cause fifteen days ago
She ain't living by herself
She slaps my hand
Why am I preaching
I wish my new day job was you
I think I need a cold shower
But the truth then and the truth now has been the same
You're my only, baby you're my only
I guess it's cool, naked with you already seen me
It's the same way you showed me
We'll let you guys prophesy
She better with some fella with a regular job."
Got your metal on, we're alone
You know I don't wanna fight
Excuse the mess it made, it usually doesn't rain
Thin air, mid-air, no
I say "Nope, I swear, I never do it"
'Cause it started the conversation
Climb trees, Michael Jackson, it all ends here
Wave 'em high, girl, to the sky
Turn back around and I was just one step too late
I wanna grab on your body
I know that your friend came with you
Sugar bunches of oats
I'm conversing with bricks and steel
And now it's so real
To stand on my feet, Momma
Maybe, I'll fall in love again
I can't, can't feel her
If you could fly, then you'd feel south
I'm screaming get out
The love will keep flowing on
Acid on me like the rain
My boss works my nerves, girl
He can't take care of you like this
Holly baby, holly baby, Hollywood, oh
My God, giving me pleasure
Did you know ?
Keep alive, stay alive
I don't wanna remember, not even for just one day
Any moment this could go
While the rain storm takes over, outrageous baby
Oh, you ought to know who you are
Every day patches the night up
Mind on the road, your dilated eyes watch the clouds float
Had no clue, I was too cool
Maybe we can get a little—a little bit, a little bit, a little bit
Now your baby momma ain't so vicious
Be no stressing, ain't no pressure
My eyes must have been on drugs
Turn back on my lights, give me fuel and water
That's a pretty long third gear in this car
I'm different now but I still carry her with me still
Oh, oh, love, love, love
And taking in the homeless sometimes
They were part of our history, this story
Was it ever real
All she want is her picket fence
And I'm running, I'm running low
I'm ready to breathe in that good air
I want to be, the one she loves
R.I.P. Trayvon, that friend look just like me
We never giving up from fighting in the club
Now we switching up the melody, ay
And she's over there
This love will keep us through blinding of the eyes 
That explains the meaning of life
Think it's time to rewind and start all over again
Pretty sweet, pretty sweet
My Nikon wasn't fast enough
Well, just a little bit, but
And the fan is blowing way too loud
Probably, uh, probably Tyler, his life seems pretty awesome. No, actually, no, fuck him. Um, I don't know, probably Dill 'cause he doesn't have to do anything at all; just sits inside his house
I try to go some months without a call
Hold her through the many years
But you kept running past the end zone
You and I try , try
Oh, oh, oh, my
Tell the government, please give me funding
I see both sides like Chanel
And keep living, yeah
There's a thief out on the move
Their home, their home
Some nights you dance with tears in your eyes
The best song wasn't the single, but you weren't either
Looks like all we've got is each other
I've searched the souls of my people
This love will keep us about 55 degrees
We're all needing, more than what they're giving
You're good at being bad, you're bad at being good
'Cause if you take me way up there
I hope that you don't think that he is the only man
Ah, on me 'ventually, 'ventually, yes
Oh, I, I do believe, I do believe
It's hell on Earth and the city's on fire
It begins to blur, we get older 
To get back up to you
In the halls of your hotel
Did you call me from a séance?
I've loved our good times here
Our daughters and our sons
Numb the pain, numb the pain 
Floor model TV with the VCR
And I swear, every conversation that I have
Hand me a towel, I'm dirty dancing by myself
Grapevines, mango, peaches, and lime, a sweet life
And I don't like to fight 'til I'm fighting 
You hit them stones and broke your home
Yo, what, what's, what's the year 3000 going to look like?
So baby follow, follow, follow
I had to go, I had to see her, see her
My pretty woman in a ball gown
How far is a light-year? How far is a light-year?
Camera flashes, turn around and she's already gone
And two limbs over shoulder, carried away
And bending over backwards
And we'll run to the future
They're telling boulder heavy lies
When I "Geronimo!" I just go "Heh"
It's not what I'm like
In the middle of the show
I love you the rest of my life, oh
I guess what we have doesn't matter
And I can't drown it out
How much I meant to you, meant it sincere back then
That's why I was always taking pictures, pictures
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh, oh
My flight left last night
Solo , solo 
But the love won't stop, no no, nah uh
I'm praying, oh, you come back again
His girl keep the scales, a little mermaid
No matter what I did, my waves wouldn't dip back then
I mean, I'm an attractive guy and all
That could dream about a thought
And now we 'bout to make up 
Solo, my cup is a rojo, my cholo, my friend
We only got one night
This is the blood, the body, the life right now
Hundreds spread out like a fan
Now what's mine is yours
Pimping in my convos
I held you in my arms
Greenspan said the rate was good
You got a roommate, he'll hear what we do
Don't even listen to the songs I record
Close my eyes and feel the crash
Yo, we got one, ayo
We talked about the weather babe
La la la la la 
We could go to my house after school
Top floor motel suite, twisting my cigars

Fake flowers, no water needed
For heaven's sakes, go to hell, nah, knock on wood, hey
And he got fight stories to tell
But there's something missing there though
So I'm gonna ask Lennon
There will be mountains you won't move
Now I'm in the lab, always working late
I've been dreaming of you, dreaming of you
And then I thought I put her on a plane
Hand of yours, girl, I'm a wreck in America
Wish I was there, wish we'd grown up on the same advice
Now there's a hole where there once was a logo, how fitting

I wanna play for you baby
It's a, it's a bad religion
Better than someone who's going through it
But can you taste a little taste?
I'm on my way home
Cymbals crash inside the pyramids
And I walk in my sleep, I can't help that 
We used to be sky high
Is cut from the same cloth, cut from the same cloth
Any of 'em that were un-southern, not me, cousin
Like a two-year-old terror, twenty-two-year-old terror
'Cause I been thinkin' 'bout forever 
I couldn't gauge your fears
Bummed-out and shit, stressed-out and shit
What's the worst thing about being me? Probably, uh
I know I'm not weak, these heavy thoughts
Is that a love crime, love crime?
You gonna feel every little bit of my love
I be dreaming of dreaming a thought
We kept the tags on them so we could remember
Guess what we have doesn't matter
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing, baby
'Cause you've convinced yourself
Remember when all I had was my mother
You're the one I've chosen, girl
This feels how molly must feel
Brash as fuck, breaching all these aqueducts
Do you think about me still?

Fathers of us be kind
I know it's true if they're just like you
I gave you the key to my city
But I'm coming to get you, coming
Fairy-tales come and take my hand
In this life , in this life 
Baby I-I'm thinking of you
I looked you in the eyes
With a swag like me
Run run run the crown of our pharaoh
We laid out on this wet floor
I'm standing by your locker
I was always taking pictures
But we're so okay here, we're doing fine
If I feel like a Ghost, no Swayze
Despite the life I lead
It meant nothing to you
If I knew she had a man
Wishing you godspeed, glory
But I know I'm not going back home, yeah
On the dance floor you're showing off your best moves
And you drive them crazy
Don't lose control, don't lose control, oh
So underestimated, you left me unaccounted for
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing, oh oh
She said she wanna be a dentist really badly
I never go faster the limit, not unless you with it
That's a double edge, "issa knife" 
Yeah, and you'll be down, you'll be down, oh
Oh no cause she ain't on the passenger, the passenger
2016: burnt some discs 
For chances of this heart in me
Mothers of us be kind
And I'm sorry for you
That's just every-day shit
That you write with it, oh
But I just call it my greedy love
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
And I wish amnesia would stay
That led to our first date, now
Or pull the zip down
My God, she's giving me pleasure
When we could only eat at Shoney's on occasion
Call my Momma like, "Momma
Could've changed this bitch a long time ago
Could I make you shy on the last night, last night?
Round your city, round the clock
You can call it jealous but I call it my greedy love
I'll buzz you in, just let me know when you outside
To your heart again
Open the sky, get a handful
All of the time
She said, "Don't let the high go to waste" 
So ohh in love, ohh in love
I couldn't understand just what I did
Used to park your car to try the bus with me
Girl, I love you
I said, oh, baby where you at?
I found you laying down with Samson
How can I be burr around L.A. coast?
If I need a parachute or something
Bending up my Nikes
You and I try, try
You're laying in the bed right next to me
You gotta let me know
Every body knows you fly, fly, fly
OK, thought about it for a minute
Gotta love me baby, quickly now
'Cause I just don't believe we're wicked 
Trying to make by, I'm trying
Rare as the feathers on my dash from a phoenix
Let me talk to you
Listening to Star Trek's star tracks
With your father's pen, oh
I'm gonna get every little bit of your love
Staying with you when I didn't have a address
God gave you what you could handle
Baby I, baby I, baby I'm thinking of you
Don't know how you got on land in the first place
Tell the truth to me, good truth to me
The sweet life, sweet life
 but I gotta answer this call

In my world, my world
Oh, yeah yeah, yeah
If the sky is pink and white
Oh, I couldn't stop staring
Carrying the pieces of two hearts
Police think I'm of the underworld
Wake up 
White leaf on my boxers, green leaf turn to vapors for the low
I know it's hard
I left her while she slept
The city belongs to me
'Cause I don't see foes
Love me now, when I'm gone, love me none
Is my love any good?
When I'm done 
We can dance all night in this bitch
Can't be my type, I'm a low life
Don't pay no attention to it
We had an American wedding
I may be, but oh I need her, need her
My ego ain't here
First moment I met you, butterflies
Their home, their home, yeah
But the distance ain't even a room away
I'm inside, I'm inside
On God he grabbed me and then that friend tried to pull me
I prefer expensive news
I know you seen it driving itself
I crossed my heart and hope to die
Stop the truck, hand my keys to the valet
But we're only in the backseat of this eclipse ooh
And blowing me kisses
Inhale, in hell there's heaven
On they're way down to you
I been pulling airplanes, higher and higher
They just walk by, they must don't care
I guess I shouldn't be
Chandeliers inside the pyramids
Boy, you know I bet the sun won't set
The way you say my name makes me feel like
Lost, lost in the heat of it all
Oh, we're in this together
Why you looking at me
All my night, you been missing all my night
The entire Earth is fighting
Show me her passport
I said ain't no sugar for you
But truth be told, my heart would be crushed
My, my greedy love
They tell me think with my brain like I'm sane
Even when I'm wrong, comfortable
Maybe it's the "me" in you that I dislike the most
Gotta have place in your world
Spirits watch me, pants down
Got a love like denim
Don't try to hide it, 'cause I see your wings
How could you run off on us?
My feelings go deeper than the ink
I'd rather chip my pride than lose my mind out here
Gliding on the five
I'm daydreaming on a strawberry swing
You ate through 'em, you ate through 'em
Keep a place for me, for me
You're old enough to drink
Can you come when I call again?
Don't no one disturb the peace for riot
If I was singing songs just to sing the songs
Then she took me home 
But how could I forget that loving you was such a rush
Keeping it surreal, whatever you like
I'll be scared to death of falling
And I'm 'a ask Stevie
Until I'm with you
I've been thinkin' 'bout you 
Everyday counts like crazy 
I'm not brave 
 To stop the taping
I've tried hell 
And you text nothing like you look
In front of your door, oh baby get in
I know we got issues, don't wanna lose you
She's got the whole wide world in her juicy fruit
If I just took what I've been given
And I'm 'a ask Donny
When we both know that deep down
No we just can't let it fall down
This whole city is mine
That's just a slow body
Don't no one hear the rounds 
They also took off the dress of that woman
I click my Js three times wishing she would've stayed
Hitting stones in glass homes

Tell me something baby, baby, I can't blame you
Long brown hair swinging, no
But you just right stand there
Still got some good nights memorized
Cause when we're together we argue two thirds of the time
Loving on each other, kissing on each other
I believe there's heaven, I believe in war
But all I want is you
Finna do a love crime
You ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
But you gotta hit the pussy raw though
I wish I could sleep without, like, being dead
Heavy as the heavens, you could tell
Each time when I closed my eyes
That you'll be in one of them
Now I'm making 400, 600, 800K, Momma
What if the sky and the stars are for show
So why not spend this flammable paper on the film that's my life?
The water's blue, swallow the pill
I never ask for much
I swear, it's crazy
Everybody has their arguments
I wanna keep that smile on your face, uh huh
Running on my mind, boy
I'm going rapidly, fading drastically
College made it different

So long I've been looking
Too many white lies and white lines
I'm lyin' down thinkin' 'bout you 
Hand washed by me and by you
You're like my favorite
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking
Savage is biking, yeah
Right now I prefer yellow
All this life in me 
To get the fixing that you're itching for
Two grams when the sun rise
 Recording each take of crying
Said you wanna hurt me now
But it won't be the last time, can't be the last time
So for 24 hours I'll been sitting here staring at his baggage in my space
That's the same way you showed me, showed me
One solar flare, we're consumed
I said yeah she got my air
Guys pull me over and then they ask me
Every time I lay my head down
Wanna feel that na na though, could you come by
Could be blue, I don't mind
Scared of the light more than the dark
My headphones won't lie, if I'm in love
That's a good look baby, baby
No, don't ever leave me 'lone
Make sure you speak up
Smoking good, rolling solo
I must be nuts, that's what they asked me
You're my pilot Jones
With nothing, with nothing
Up for air from the swimming pool
Said I would catch her every tear
Yeah, 'cause the friend tried to boom me in my face
But memories don't last
Those are my friends for life
Got everybody complementing you
I was way too cool, I'm way too cool
I ain't on no sales floor
Pilot Jones, pilot Jones
Waves are washing me out
Daddy told you that I was dangerous
Live so much better, live so much better
We'll be making love, baby
All around to taste those malls that
Since you been gone, I been having withdrawals
I know that we sin, but I do believe we try 
But if I got a condo on a cloud
With ours lives, 'cause they're simply too short
But look at you loving a fool, making it easy
If love was sky, damn right I'm falling
You mean so much to me
Readjusting to the fact she's been gone
And there ain't enough sheep on my ceiling to count
Gone off tabs of that acid
We all have issues that we need to deal with, can we talk about it?
Could have been Wednesday, just not today, day
Admitted, they kiss her over and over and over
You put me on a feeling I never had
Wave 'em high now, to the sky
Said if I was in NY I should look you up
One day you gonna fall in love
Who needs another friend? I need to hold your hand
On comes the evening, gold seeking ends
I hated every time we go out
The smile on your face when you got that text late at night wasn't 'cause of me
I feel it on me now
Just saying it, we being real persons
A rocky, rocky world
Two mopeds racing through the forest
I don't wanna dream about him
I said well then we might as well make ours the same
It's the difference between having a home and living on the streets
Feel her, feel her, oh
Saying I'm always complaining
Red bottoms in your high heels
If we stop this fighting
I saw the sky like I never seen before
Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Call myself being a hero trying to guard your heart
I'm standing, still 'til you're with me
I'm feeling like Stanley Kubrick
And you said it's all mine
If I had 20 million dollars in the vault somewhere, baby
He don't care for me, but he cares for me
That's a pretty fucking fast year flew by
Holly baby, holly baby, Hollywood
Arm around my shoulder so I could tell
I just wanna make love

Move on 
Poolside convo about your summer last night, ooh yeah
When I do, I cut the pony off
Big enough to take these broken hearts and put 'em in it
Away turf, no Astro
Roaming around like I'm ready for a funeral
'Cause it's the same color as the lace on my neck
When I'm running out, you keep your bags packed
Look into your eyes, pretty waves of brown
How much dope can you push to me?
Um, you're my GOLDEN GIRL
Without 'em, fuck 'em, I tell 'em this ain't new
I know you wouldn't hurt a beetle
The jewel of Africa
You can't get up and get a job
I'ma run it into the ground, Momma, the whole galaxy
What happened, we were close
I'm scared of you
I got to know girl, I ain't running out
Making pretty love to me, pretty
Then put the whole wide world on her hands
This feel like a quaalude
Wishing the day go away, day go away, today go away
I thought I saw walking right past me
Be no fighting if you keep on rocking that shit
Everything was okay when I was the victim
Something bout you love me
Far's too close and I remember my memory's no sharp
What if my mother comes over?
With only my brain
How you feel ?
Women try, men try
If that dress looks fabulous, don't hide it
Spending each day of the year
Hopped into my car; drove far
If I could see through walls, I could see you're faking
It sucks not having you here
Who the hell knows who Purple Rain is?
There's a monsoon that never ends
Although you got beaucoup family
Always sleeping past the breakfast she makes
See me bummed-out, stressed-out
Did-didn't I can't feel nothing, superhuman
Can't let this thing fall apart
Someone brings up your name, just this one day I don't know
No, nothing wrong  with a lie 
I don't believe our nation's flag is on the moon
You'd need no other man, we'd flee to other lands
Let it be some jazz playing
Maybe I could find something in the club
I don't think so, I'm pretty open with all – everything that I do
She's thinking maybe the next one should have something to do with me, to do with me
'Cause you want it when you want it
Thick girls are made for cuddling
I really love my fans
Cry, cry, cry, oh
The crows on Saturn, then I'm back in L.A
Shorty, my plane just now touched down
You got it baby
I wanna see the details inside those beautiful eyes
They so vain, I tell 'em this ain't you
Wanna see nirvana, but don't wanna die yet
And never mind the faded
Tell me how does that taste
I'm cold when the temperatures dip below 70s

My second, my third
But don't you look down
Just got them little basic ones that the pictures frames come with
But we both know that deep down
12 treat a friend like he twelve
I got you up in my house now, ow
I don't know, there would be a lot of things I'll do, probably spend a lot of time with my family and tell them I'm going away and probably spend a couple hours with my family and then I'll go out and just do everything that I ever thought about trying
Oh no, you'll never know he's lying
Hades got the angels
This is has been the one of my fears
She's the past, you're my future, my right now
Signal coming in and out
Girl, you know you're lost
Open up the door
You left when I forgot to speak
It's 12:07 and I'm thinking 'bout him 
You tore me down till there was nothing left
Now it all makes sense, I've put it together
A hundred more will never do
As I told you from the beginning, I don't have money
Super rich kids with nothing but fake friends
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known, ever known
The sky could be blue, could be grey
All the things I didn't mean to say, I didn't mean to do
I don't know. There's a lot of things you could do
It's good times, yeah
Overload, overload, overload, take over for me
Give it back to me
But if my job was only to love you, yeah
And friend, if I did it, I think you can too
You know could make you smile
I ain't a kid no more, we'll never be those kids again
She had the kind of body that would probably intimidate
For forgetting every little anniversary
Can we talk about it without the shouting?
If you wanna ride out 
Oh, real love, I'm searching for a real love
Used to it being dark at night, and you're kinda afraid of the lights
Let me run this bitch
Do you remember, that October night
'Til you feel you're ready
But, girl, I can't feel my face
I'm standing, standing still
Let go of a prayer for you
Hit the road like a runner
24 hours like they never close
The leaders are lying
How you do it, and don't ever let me down
You used to to get a little cut-up from time to time
Got one that's straight acting
We celebrated its invention
You got me fighting every night to prove my love
You're the dealer and the stoner
No ends 'cause you're timeless
You said it never rains in southern Cali
Tell me, tell me
But they say my checks come from the bank
I been moving buses, further and further
I don't know what it's like with a skirt on
She won't say hello, hello, hello
The sun's going down
Took some time but we collided
And some nights you're dancing
You write me love letters
My every-night shit, my every-day shit
So be ready in a hour
Like wildcats running on the grass, hey
I feel their smiles on me 
Scared of the truth so much more than the lie
Exit La Cienega, I'm looking, I'm searching
You don't even got nobody being honest with you
Who's that laughing in my library? Is that you?
When I'm done 
But you turned your bedroom light on
It's really you on my mind
Try to catch one if you can
I'm out here checking for my, angel in L.A., L.A
But it ain't easy, you won't make it easy
You're good at being bad 
I'm spending too much time on the ground, baby please show me how
But when it comes to love you think
Them label hoes be stealing my shit
Now shit starting to make my hands hurt
This shower head feels so amazing

Been tryna film pleasure with my eyes wide shut
Boss ain't working you like this
Now give it to me
They have taken Cleopatra
Just want to keep you here
You run my mind, boy
If I sing songs to get at women
'Cause my dad don't clock off 'til late

Then put your panties on in the mirror, Cleopatra
You know you were my first time .
'Cause it's surely melting
I think I started something
I should be paying y'all, honest to God
Oh, wait a minute baby girl can we just sit down
Her song has me
Say that you love it
Girl, I love the things you do
Not in my spirit, keep it alive 
'Cause father is gone
To the fathers on whom we rely
But darling, this only worsens
Just that one look, oh, oh
Stay, go, stay, go, stay
White rag up in the sky
Angel search downtown, now I'm on the 10 West
Have a little faith
Likes to fuck boys in bands
The star shine always kept you warm
I'm not heavy no, I promise
But I'm a boy
To me, it's nothing but a one-man cult
I'm running from the man, I'm running from my flag
And now it's not so clear
The one my momma like so much
Oh, oh, from going in these circles
She signed her name in pen 
A tornado flew around my room before you came
You always smoking in the house
That could think of dreaming a dream
Before we go at it again
He ain't quite me, like me
Do you, do you?
I'm searching for a real love, talking 'bout real love
Girl my phone bill is crazy
Novacane, baby, I want you
She's got the whole wide world in her hands
No white lighters 'til I fuck my 28th up
It feels like I'm riding the bench
Pretty clear mind, I feel like, sometimes
I didn't wanna get her involved
But your love ain't free no more, baby
Now film it with that drone cam, in the pink like Killa Cam
But them courts won't side with you
The deer run across, kill the headlights
For tuition, doing porn in the Valley
And the seed that's inside of my heart, baby
Kick off my shoes
The first word I learned to say or that I ever said
'Cause it pays way better babe
Give me tourists, give me traffic
Oh, oh, oh, oh
In the middle of Arkansas with a little rock left in that glass dick
All damn day long
No matter how hard I fought, it was over before it started
I'm knocking on your door, and it's cold, yes it's cold
Said that Gucci taste good, but Dior taste amazing
So they're gonna fire me soon
Saying they want something real from a man
Don't try to hide it, everybody knows you fly
I need the answers, I want to ask my friends
Well I guess you coulda
I wanna go up, take me up
And now that's the very reason
Bubbles in my champagne
Are you ready to go? We gon' be waiting in line
It's such a crazy world you'll see
I begged you to stay
I know that you're going to
So all I got to do is whatever the fuck I want
Don't you convince yourself
Don't wan't you to think I'm playing
Look up, look up
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
It's too heavy for me
I'm rushing cause I'm missing my boo, my my baby
That could think of the dreamer that thought
And they come from far away to meet ya'
I didn't know what to say
And you're golden, uh, your eyes open, fuck it
Planning a runaway, young at heart
I, I know that you'll never find another nigga
'Cause what would this place be without your smile?
I can hear the children soccer balling
And I still got the same hope that I started with
So low my halo stay way low, it feels like it's bent
In the getaway car
While the plot was thickening
Calling a truce, calling a truce
friend, you got some just like me don't you?
Just tell me how
I'm scared for you

What it means to be alive on this side
On my way, I'm coming
This is some visionary shit
You need that girl
Or dream about him
If I was being honest
Like when you get mad at me, do you really mean what you say?
You say I'm changing on you
Got a wedding band done
My eyes like them red lights
Whole team diamonds is real
Even though that won't change a thing
I can't trust no one
You know I can't hear none of that spend the night shit
Blowing kisses to me through the window of the bus
This the last song so, I'm finna wipe that off
It's all downhill from here
When they call you home
I kept loving, ah, ah
We had time to kill back then
Cotton candy, Majin Buu, oh, oh, oh
Then hit you with the, "You know it's mid, right?"
I would've never admit I had it bad, oh
Help me out, help me out
We're lost in a jungle underneath these clouds
We take it down to a minor C, C
I know I've been gone
In this adult body
Clearly this isn't all that there is
See there you go reaching up your blouse
Wondering why does she walk like that 
I wanna stare at you some more
Her body said get over here
Talking 'bout, do they sew wings on tailored suits

I'm losing focus, focus, focus
'Cause this little hustle's getting you by
Got a love like, got a love like that
So, baby, don't take this hard
I may be younger, but I'll look after you
Well, gimme some more baby
You gotta let me read just a page of you baby
Ooh baby say it to my face
Now, to the edge I'll race
My pastor says that your faith is major
Just like a two-year-old terror, a twenty-two-year-old terror
But you're so buff and so strong
But I won't stop loving you that's for sure, that's for sure
Oh baby baby stop there, right there
So tell me your name or something, she said "Is it game or something?"
Look at all the people feet dance
Bet-bet-better than the radio
No, I don't like you, I just thought you were cool
Baby I could show you the world
Like a bottle of Evian, you can see through me
Only thing she's been grilling is me
One more mile 'til the road runs out, out
I won't let her go
I'm still not losing hope, though the sky's getting dark
Send the cheetahs to the tomb
These same lips that once said I love you, I do, I do
Comes falling on my lawn
But I gotta know for sure
We'll go around the world, don't ever go
'Cause I didn't wanna miss you
But the lights is gonna be on us
This ain't making sense no more
Dick could roll the eyes back in the skull
Every girl that I met on tour
Nor have I ever, have I ever let you get caught?
I brought trees to blow through, but it's just me and no you
And I never thought I'd say this baby
Last week I was washing your towels
Dark skin of a summer shade
Rewrote all my wrongs in pencil
Who's that talking in my library? Is that you?
And now you wanna get away, get away
Audience kept yelling, "Not the space
Steam both sides of the L
Yeah, I need you, oh I need
Don't let him see divide
You wanna get blasted, yeah
And girl I hope you missed me
I thought that I was dreaming when you said you love me
Working at the pyramid tonight
Bedtime but I can't sleep
'Til the hurricane comes, 'til the tsunami comes
Everything grows in the Congo
I been writing all day, filling my page
Been waiting for this moment
No record of the love we had
Oh, suddenly I caught ya
To the end I'll make it
I feel their smiles on me 
Gotta love me baby, quick now
It's better up here you know
Set the cheetahs on the loose
Oh, up here, up here
We don't need them but you like them
Take over for me, it's too heavy for me
There with my crooked teeth and companion sleeping, yeah
Sitting on edge of my seat now
The audience yelling, "Damn, she's blind."
That's what it is, it's not just money
I used to put an apple on Ms. Jacob's desk
Can you feel my heart beating, oh
Don't try to hide it, cause I see your wings
Buying an apartment with ya
For heaven's sakes, go to hell
I'm building y'all a clock, stop, what am I, Hemingway?
We're all chasing after our ends
The hardest thing to say is what I ain't saying
And I'm sorry for ya
So in love, ohh in love
Novacane for the pain, for the pain
With the sweetest kiss I've ever known
In comes the morning, haunting us with the beams
On my lapel, at the table, I'm giving a toast
How you breathing up here with nothing on, nothing on, baby girl
When we first met, I know you told me that your taste was crazy
And I slowly hum, sing the simple phrase
Hey baby, I've noticed you eat your jewelry for break
Arm stretch a tee like I nailed it
I fell in love with you, girl, oh-ooh
Ain't gon' be tripping over some bitch-ass, dude
I'm clicking my heels wishing away the day
How it feels to have arrived
And I can't even play Madden any more
Making love on the coffee table
But I brought your favorite flowers, teddy bear and a card
I heard my teacher say that I'd be better off
Too much water can you push it back
But I know that you know my buttons
What am I gonna show to my kids, girl?
Through the sky 
Now I'm driving 'round on the boulevard, trunk bleeding
It can't be hard
Crooked cop, dead cop
My camera shed some tears since you left him
I know you don't need me right now
That soft pink matter
Got the keys so we're gone, oh
So I guess I gotta love you while I'm here baby
Now baby look up at the star
I keep praying that it won't exist no more
Run run run come back for my glory
That's the only time I ran from a friend
My dream maker, heart breaker
Has anybody seen her?
We were at the bar for quite a while
And it can't be the last time, when you say I don't do this
And staying in love won't be so hard, it's simple."
Since Ben Baller sold all his ice up at Slauson, ooh
'Cause when you was with him
And I just wanna know
At least you working
Old folks used to tell me, I know it and I felt it
Stop thinking of this as being money
Got your girl working for me
Head bang with my faux friends
Yeah, you look good, would I fuck? Yeah
How you blind and you can't see it
That you could sell for me
That's the reason why I kept this love in the dark

Something silly like me leaving up the toilet seat
This love will keep us cool
One with the water
Then I guess you can stay at my place
The feeling still deep down is good
Can't keep being laid off
Nosedive into flood lines
You look up and they tell you it's a godless sky, a godless sky
Knock, knock, knock, knock on wood
And once I finish here
But there's no drug around
While the rockets burn, they're burning
African girl speaks in English accent
Jay hit me on the email, said I oughta act my net worth
Stick shift won't get in the groove but I'm coming
I guess I always treat you like a baby girl
You were just about to break up
I believe that marriage isn't
Sitting in the front row, only ones here
He wrapped the whole wide world in a wedding band
She told me every story behind all of her tattoos
In the sky up above, the birds
You showed me love
She woke me up to give me half
For the pain, for the pain 
Like the Earth is shaking
And the sound will make you cry
Oh no, matter what I'll be here
Oh, do me baby
If my job was only to love you, girl
I'm biking, I'm biking, I'm biking these blocks, yeah

Who is the fairest of them all
Gotta be with her, with her, with her
Makes it a little harder to tell a lie don't it?
Every single record, autotuning
No, I won't put you out
If a tree fell in the forest
I got a question I wanna ask my momma
Oh, right now they're flying
I sat down in my car, not to leave, just to park
I'll take it later, I'll be right there
Just a virgin lover on a getaway, get away
For something to believe in
Had me made out to be so naive
Tuition wasn't high enough
You're catching that breeze 'til you're dead in the grave
But I wanna, I really wanna
I bought it and I placed it on the table next to me
Forrest green, Forrest blues
Said you should get a Rubi's Cube over your heart
She told me that, told me that
You hit them stones and you broke your home
It's just a skull, least that's what they call it
That I have loved
If I have love for ya
I made love to my lady before I packed
What's the surprise? What's the surprise? What's the surprise?
Got, got me fucked up
I don't get weak in the knees
I stayed at home and you didn't
Can't blend in, too perfect
It's so much more than that
Shining like diamonds in a rocky world
I'm standing, still fucking waiting
Used to have a backpack full of that work
Make it a private show, intimate affair
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
You been holding your breath, weighted down
Just grab a pencil, don't you wanna help out
Fell asleep without a dream
As we march to the rhythm
Shut the fuck up, I don't want your conversation
We got so familiar
I saw the light fade
It won't stop, oh no, oh no, oh no

I made you the mayor of my town honey
Mind over matter is magic, I do magic
I didn't care to state the plain
I knew none of them would last
So so so, tell, tell me, tell me something
Got a beach house I could sell you in Idaho
I promise she'll be whipping meals up for a family of her own some day
Some tattooed eyelids on a facelift
I can't believe I'm even talking to you, telling you this right now
I can't tell you the truth about my disguise
We smell of Californication
Stroke of harmony, kiss you on your neck
'Cause who could understand the pain
I can't feel, feel her
That's all I've got in my name
I thought that we were
Hey yo, we got one
Oh, we're all children
Can't keep up a conversation
I've been dreaming, dreaming
And used the shit for batting practice
First word that I spoke it made you smile
Speaking of Nirvana, it was there
She's the prettiest girl I've ever seen on a skateboard
Eh, murder, murder, murder she wrote
No oh, not for mine
When I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
Halfway on a slow move
Sometimes I feel like I'm a god, but I'm not a god
Leave the meter running
Uh oh oh, oh oh oh ooh whoa
I won't be crying no more no water will fall
Like I watched you
Sleet snow grind for the wealth
I will never let them cry
I think I'm begging, cause now that everything's gone
I say, "Boy, don't judge, 'cause, hell, if you were me..."
Think I want me a little one that look like my clone
You're my golden girl
While the sky burns
Can't afford to visit her
Women try, men try 
I used to work on my feet for 7 dollars a hour
Tell 'em it ain't likely
And when the last song plays, you'll look up
Got, got me fucked up, up
Only after we get to the end
So why are you here
Oh time machine, maybe we can take her with us
You're shucking and jiving, stealing and robbing
Fucking on you when I didn't own a mattress
Hit the road like Road Runner
know and know, know and know
Oh angel, tell me what am I to do?
Eat some 'shrooms, maybe have a good cry about you
Was I working just way too hard?
Late night coming to my crib
Adamant and he thrashing
Nah, nah, she won't
And what we have with this
I don't cuff bitches no more
No clouds, shades on, no sun
What I'm saying is, there'll be ups and down
But I thought we were
There wasn't room for you and I
I guess it couldn't hurt me
No smiles on my picture frame, no
I'm kind of nervous
You can sing along to my songs, and then
Waiting on you, can't do it by myself

To be the baby daddy?
I had my feet in the water
Gotta love me like you know the worlds about to end, baby
Show me how you do it, how you show me up
But you should know, you should hear
Give up, just tonight, night, night
I'll be standing here, seconds forward
From my Lou's I'm seeing colors
I will always love you how I do
No snitching allowed from my baby
I know you love to talk
Simple math, pen and pad; gotta work out
Hell yeah, switch it up
"Bo Bo, you need prayer"
Temper tantrums out in public
To the mothers on whom we rely
Then I'll applaud you, and then
Making dirt clouds on a path, on a path
Talking 'bout a real love
This a cult, not a clique on the net
Do you even care? Yeah I thought so
New beginning's, wake up akh
Older kids trying off the roof
I trust you, like a brother
I know we got issues, I don't wanna lose you
Right next to sucker, and I am the buster, girl
What do you do?
La Brea, Santa Monica, Sunset, Sepulveda
I'mma take it slow, slow
It's quite alright to hate me now
No matte black on the ride 'cause it's stale
When I can feel you in my soul
My TV ain't HD, that's too real
When they come crashing down
Then maybe we could move one 
But the freaks ain't trying to sleep with cracky
No I don't really wish
We took chartered flights
And not your heart
This is not my life
I put in work, oh, I put in work
Preaching self-made millionaire status
No trees to blow through but blow me and I owe you
Ain't seen rainbows in the sky since college
And what a difference it makes, you'll see
So why did you leave
White Ferrari, had a good time
Piece in my hands worth twice than a friend

Dancing in the front row, only one here
I'm biking downhill and it sound like a fishing rod
And some don't end the way they should
She took me high 
Got a fighter jet, I don't get to fly it, though
And start chiseling away, away
Fuck with me after my shift
And I've got all the world, nothing to show
Don't no one wanna blow the high
They have taken Cleopatra, Cleopatra
And no, I won't stay in Rome
You could open your window baby
A simple, simple mistake
There's not enough windows
A love that lasts, a love that lasts
Am I in love?
Oh, loving and living and loving
But that just don't do it for me
But the real ones just like you, just like me
The market's down like 60 stories
Even just one day is one too long
I've found my gold
Speaking of the, don't know what got into people
Don't know why see the world, when you got the beach?
And I, know I was in love with you
You're cold as bricks and steel
Sangria in a canteen
Such a good look
Live so much better than the radio
Gotta keep it that, that, that, that
You really think it'd be that easy just to let me go
Just wore that dress cause you knew that we'd all be watching you
We used to be major
I came to visit, 'cause you see me like a UFO
You say some shit about me?
Give me noise, just give it back
Numb the pain, numb the pain, numb the pain
Say what up to Danny
Hit the strip and my bills paid
You're not alone, I'm not alone
Said you want a private show, said you want a private show
And every time the cops pull me over, they don't ever see them
I'm gon' let my nuts hang
I'm not him, but I'll mean something to you
Still I'll always be there for you how I do
I'm afraid to say it
I'll stack these magazines in the corner
And that's cost you years
Solo, solo, solo, solo
Tell me now, I got the memories
And you need me here
I'm just a guy, I'm not a god
You were swimming at the bottom, yeah
I said why you gon' live down there
What are we smoking anyway?
Get some gushy, have a calm night
That you can't do
Off to the nearest one who woulda rolled because of who I am
Don't you let her see divide
The storm has passed and gone
And I'm looking through the pictures in the shoe box under my bed
Feels like I'm on the 30th floor
I know, you told em baby
Twins know and Lance know, Clark know and Matt know
What's the most amazing thing you've ever witnessed?

I don't wanna talk about him
But you can't always get your way, like a baby girl
What was cooler than us?
You'll probably leave later, anyway
I found my black queen Cleopatra
I remember, how could I forget ?
Got me fucked up, up
I still can't feel my face
Cocaine for breakfast, yikes
If models are made for modeling
Your mother invites me to dinner
On God, you should match it, it's that KO
So I text the speech, lesser speeds, Texas speed, yes
The city is mine, honey
And I don't believe they're short, this is interlude
Just the same way you showed me, showed me
Not ever, not ever, no
You'll never see it coming
I think a lot, a lot, too much. Sometimes I'm very musty
Yeah, I need you, yeah, I need you
But let's just say I wouldn't stop hustling even when you asked me
Chloe, shh, okay, start over right now
Vegas might as well be light-years away
I wanna run away from the words
If we don't have to live through hell just to get to heaven
It's just money, I'ma make more
God damn, fuck these lames, they don't want none
And I believe you when you say that you've lost all faith
Friendship and how it controls the world
I heard you could fly, could you try
Crack rock, crack rock, crack rock
Cause all of your exes are in black and white
How am I supposed to remember?
Is the story real? You don't even know
Met her at Coachella
Daydreams of the romance
I just know he's jealous
We have good discussion
She's at a stove 
Oh yeah, oh yeah
'Cause what would this place be without my muse?
Real love, ain't that something rare
I'mma send a car to come get you from your house
Balanced on my head like steak knives
Close my eyes and fall into you, you, you
Working through your worst night
I can't do without you
Or you'll never see it coming
Now you want to call me to your office right after school
Look up, look up, I know
Back home with that, next time
They burn from the cigarettes
That's right love me
I couldn't see the floor beneath you
A sweet life, yeah
If I'm in love
Take over for me
So we gotta move quickly
You're jumping off the walls, no more sugar for you
I'm not going back home, no
I feel their smiles on me 
Five more miles 'til the road runs out
Give it to me
Working at the pyramid
Who's that laughing in my library?
But let's take all the frames off your walls
That's a pretty big trunk on my Lincoln town car, ain't it?
She's on her own tour
I got new bags, and they're all collabs
That we would grow old together
They're coming down, coming down
Mesmerized how the strobes glow
That was my part of the deal, honest
Baby let me be the guide
You gotta believe in something, something, something
I'm trying to fix your cable box, again
Dreaming a thought that could dream about a thought
In the hallway after class
Tell me how does that taste, oh
And try to be ready when I get there
Keep you cool when it's still alive
Ball so hard, all my boys flex
I know the truth is blinding
I don't wanna let you go, never let go
Like Jigga in summer
But I couldn't stop hustling, even if he asked me
My buttered toast on the side
Where did we go wrong
Wish you were the water there
A love that lasts, a love that we can wear
Baby, I, I still got one bullet left
I run my hands through what's left
Models, wedding pictures, you know
Wherever you're going, I'm going the same
Toying with Raggy Anns and Mammy done had enough
Here's to the gay bar you took me to
My whole body see through
Who's this other guy, that's sending you these flowers
I know I'm begging, cause now that everything's dried up
Weed crumbles into glitter
Keep telling her I love that girl
Life's just around the bend, my friend
Even my heartbeat wakes me up
Oh yeah, you know it's true
You don't mind them flaws, you've already seen them all
That you never could've felt under all that pressure
She peels an orange for us in the morning
Are just candles in the sun
I'm going off 
I'm burning out, I'm showing off
My heart  breaker
They don't last enough
She's working at the pyramid tonight
Traffic killing me, barely can groove but I coming, yeah I'm coming
Tryna help her, help her
Crossing in style someday
Already figured out the love
But I'm still unemployed
Love lost, lost? Love, love
Oh, I'm on the front line of disaster
Girl, I love you, still
You're lacing your sneakers
News said that the sky is falling
Don't go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go
Where'd you go? Where'd you go? Where'd you go?
Cause it pays way better babe
I wish you could taste it
Now we outside and the timing's perfect
I wish you could see what I see
But look at you, loving a fool, making it easy
Tell me it's a love crime
Them sidewalks calling to me 
That this was much more than just some night shit
Stayed up 'til my phone died, smoking big, rolling solo
But my mind's going crazy
By dinner Mr. Benjamin was sitting in awe
Till you look up
You're the cutest, you're the cutest thing aw yeah
Spend it when I get that
If I was I don't know which heaven would have me, Momma
Gingerbread Benz, and you said you dug it

I think I hear 'em coming down the hall

'Cause this ain't no work day, she don't give head anyway
Know them boys wanna see me broke down and shit
I'm "Richard Gere" in a tux
Circling and coasting the sky
And not my heart
Fuck me good, fuck me long, fuck me numb
If this is love, I know it's true
I'm not looking from the outside
No more, no more
Until the years just started to flicker past
It's cool, it's cool
When I'm older, and my mind is telling me to forget you
Back it up, back it up, back it up, up, up
I have bills to pay, but that meant nothing to you
But he ain't with you
I got that act right in the Windy City that night
That might be what you need
You spilled your wine all over the floor
Top chopped down like blades came through the valley
It takes a strong young man to survive out here
With the streets all dark, it looks like my buildings are gone
No wonder why there's no mirrors on these walls no more
No sleep in my body
Can't hold up the world
Saw my lightning, click, click, click
Guess I gotta treat you like a baby girl
How molly must feel
So comfortable, so comfortable, so comfortable
If you only knew what I'm thinking about
I got the memories
Simple man, couple simple problems
I'm why you are the senate representative
And the best advice I got was keep writing, yeah
Watching the summer come close to an end
But she never liked me
The city mine, baby
I'm dying for your love I don't know what you want
Big bang, big bang, look at what we made beautiful
She said 'cause my skin wasn't light enough
I say, "Nah," they say, "OK, I don't believe it"
It ain't an event no more
This wedding ring won't ever wipe off
 And I can't change it
And ever since I've been tryna get it back
Getting married in a courthouse
You're packing your things and
Sometimes you'll miss it
Balance bricks on shoulders
I'm living over city
Still remember, had you going crazy
She said I'm gon' fail, no matter what I give
Cause you know that this love is gonna last
It's so funny, he's a sucker for love
She can feel my every line
A Bentley that used to be flawless
You want love? Well no more sugar for you
And when I tap your shoulder
Wish I could use a calculator, but it won't even work
You ain't gone get far
And every time a brother ask me
Ha-ha-ha, alright, um, what three superpowers do you wish you had? My bad. Say it again
Please give me my trees, give 'em back
And I tell you 
Oh, now you tell me, that your ex is your best friend
But now you're right here, oh
As the time flies faster baby
8 minutes ago it was all OK, yeah
And they come from far away to meet ya
About your summer last night
And I, you know I'm hoping you're watching me too
Yo, we got one
I think I got a clue
Falling in love, but going up
I want you to go
Said I saw my life flash by that very instant
Levitating off the mattress
Is it just a container for the mind?
Hope you're doing well, bruh
You got a scholarship to Michigan State
But you're beautiful to me, oh 
It pays way better baby, yeah
Thinking maybe someone is not something to own

Open my mouth and the words do fall
But I made it look easy 
I met his friends last week
I ain't on your schedule
But deep inside I know that you don't wish you woulda
Gave you tools just to stay alive
Without her to give it to me
But your bitch my exception
Turn a real sport, my friend
But between then and now we can go far
Can we make love before you go
Why you ain't been going to work
Ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah, ah-hah
How do I stay in love with your rubbish
And I just can't move them alone
In comes the morning 
Oh, it's 'til it's time we die
We're not in love, but I'll make love to you
It don't matter, it don't matter, you've seen it all before

She don't love ya, love ya
It's no thing, it's nothing
I was screaming, "Run forty-four!"
I know you got someone coming
And I yam from the line
We breathin' pheromones, Amber Rose
See I don't even wanna think about him
Let 'em know, them lights will never turn off
Cause were strong and we look good in denim
As the daylight fell
Said you liked Ruth's Chris way better
I mean my balls sticking to my jeans
'Cause I'd see your wings if that dress was backless
Now you're lost, lost in the heat of it all
Watch you, you tell 'em baby
Everybody needs you, everybody needs you
I still believe in man 
If you were never here?
I know you gotta leave
Scared of the good more than the evil
It's coming down, it's coming
I want to be, the song she loves
Don't talk me out of it
You gotta believe in something, something, something, oh, oh
I still believe in man
It's strobing, baby, and they burning baby
I'm crossing you in style someday
To the places you know
Where I cannot, where I cannot
Never had a clue
When all I want is you to myself
I'm humming to the song playing in my head when I first met you
I need that girl
The best song wasn't the single
You and I 
Cause it wouldn't work, nah it wouldn't work
I know you're somewhere in there
Silence in the ears, darkness of the mind 
You seem to move fame or get the money bringing you down
Go head, fly that thing!
Come on, put your hand in my back pocket lets walk
You found a boyfriend
He don't hear a word I say at all
The throne of our queen is empty
I'm in the chair
Feels like I'm on the sideline
Love me as long as you're fed, you said
I'd rather live outside
So now as the credits roll
Clean chakra, good karma
Me and them gel, like twigs with them bangs
Told me to take that ink like a man
This great grey matter
I say that you should leave but don't go
Let's put this moment on replay
I pointed them out as I went along
And ask me to go away
There's such a crazy world to see
I need love, need love, need love, need love
Throw team on back like I tatted the Mariah 
Numb, numb, numb, numb
That light bulb, took something from me
Indian girl sleeps above the temple
Don't talk to me

Matthew got a lens on me right now, yeah
Follow the leader, baby girl
But I wish you'd come back before the sun comes up again
You're beautiful to me
Baby in the night
That we're slamming doors
I wanna crack his dome, 

I told myself I had to have it
So easy to love
I've been thinkin' 'bout you
Wish it could have been Tuesday, just not today
There wouldn't be no stressing
And I know it'll work girl
Alright, make sure you speak up
She told me to take that ink like a man
That's the way every day goes
So low that no more high horses, so hard to wear Polo
Maybe if I board a plane, I could be at the sunrise
Stealing granny cigs 
Said I'm sorry, oh baby
We end our day up on the roof
Cause if you take me way up there
Just turn the lamp down
And they yelling my name out
I'm dying for your love, I don't know what you want
Get on 
You love attention from a big crowd
It was dying to be free
A million one, a million two
We're twenty-five thousand feet in the air baby
Love crimes, love crimes
Baby, does it go boom?
I free-fall off the hill again
It's everything I thought it would be 
But when we talkin' about something
It just might break her heart, man
If you wanna go, promise we can go, oh
So low that I am no rookie but feel like a kid
Got some pretty good beats on this 808s CD, yeah
'Cause I've been thinkin' 'bout forever 
Okay, well you gotta do mine in color
It's not you it's us that she's worried about
And when to press them, baby, dammit
Gave you, power over, power over me
Don't try stopping me
Here's to the highlights when I was convinced
